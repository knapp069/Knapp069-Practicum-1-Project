"Onboarding new log sources should be easy. That’s why we’ve expanded the number of Beats LogRhythm Administrators
can manage from the Web Console
. By onboarding log sources in the Web Console, you can save time and cut your Beat Administration workload in half. In this latest release, LogRhythm now supports management for six additional Beats including:
Gmail Message Tracking
Gmail Message Tracking
GSuite

Managing a SIEM platform isn’t always easy, so our team has made your experience even better. LogRhythm 7.15 features platform improvements that enhance your workflows, save you time, and reduce the number of steps your team takes to complete a task.

As CentOS 7 reaches the end of life from the Red Hat organization, we understand the importance of providing an alternative operating system to migrate Data Indexer (DX) and Open Collector (OC) machines. That’s why LogRhythm created a
detailed guide for migrating to Rocky Linux
. This migration path offers customers continued support from the OS vendor to address security and bug fixes.

To make the workflow and tasks easier for LogRhythm SIEM users, we’ve changed a setting to auto-populate the flat file path for Windows Event Log-based log sources. For example, when users add Windows PowerShell or Windows SysMon Event logs, LogRhythm SIEM now auto-updates that field. This update saves users time and provides a more streamlined experience.


LogRhythm has made it easier to convert time zones when exporting logs from the Web Console to a CSV file. Customers can now export CSV files in their local time zone versus having to convert from the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) time zone. Now users don’t have to go through the cumbersome conversion process to identify the correct time, improving their experience with the SIEM platform.


Navigating to an alarm from a notification is easier than ever. Our team improved the experience to direct you to alarm details even if you previously weren’t logged into the Web Console. After clicking a URL in a notification and logging into the Web Console, LogRhythm now automatically routes you to the correct alarm. This update saves you time and removes the hassle of searching for important notifications.

In SIEM 7.15, we’re continuing to improve the
Resource Center
. We’ve added in-app tutorials to help new users quickly understand how to leverage the power of LogRhythm. Our newest tutorials are listed in the Onboarding section of the Resource Center. Onboarding topics include Dashboards, Searches, Case Management, Alarm Management, and Beat Management. These topics will help a new LogRhythm SIEM Analyst or Administrator understand the key principles of LogRhythm SIEM. With the Resource Center, users can quickly view in-app Announcements and Onboarding tutorials and easily access Documentation, Community, and Support.

We are constantly enhancing our ability to help our customers collect and receive value from log sources in their environment. A big part of that is constantly making updates to our parsing policies via KB updates.
We get it, technology changes at a rapid pace. This often means LogRhythm needs to revisit log sources we already support and help customers derive more value by accounting for changes and quickly evolving.
LogRhythm is continuing to review our supported log sources and make updates to strengthen our correlation and analysis. Our new and enhanced methods of ingestion include:
Source
LogRhythm Enhancement
Fortinet FortiNAC
New log support for FortiNAC, which protects against IoT threats, extends control to third-party devices, and orchestrates automatic responses to a wide range of networking events.
strongSwan VPN

Tenable OT
New policies help prevent classification errors and provide more consistent parsing of log source data for Tenable Operational Technology (OT). And new MPE rules parse log metadata to the correct schema fields and classify highly complex log source data.
QRadar
New log support for QRadar Network Security, which is used to detect hidden threats on your networks with deep, broad visibility and advanced analytics.
Mimecast
Updated policies and workflow for collecting logs from Mimecast.
Imperva Database Activity Monitor (DAM)
Updated policies help prevent classification errors and provide more consistent parsing of log source data for Imperva Database Activity Monitor (DAM). Andd new MPE rules parse log metadata to the correct schema fields and classify highly complex log source data.
Palo Alto Cortex Data Lake
Updated policies for schema changes to help prevent classification errors and provide more consistent parsing of log source data for Palo Alto Networks® Cortex Data Lake, which provides cloud-based, centralized log storage and aggregation for your on-premise, virtual (private cloud and public cloud) firewalls, for Prisma Access, and for cloud-delivered services such as Cortex XDR.

The LogRhythm Web Console allows you to monitor network log activity from supported browsers on desktop computers and laptops.
To support the most common end-user activities, the Web Console offers a customizable user interface with colorful visualizations and a range of powerful analytical and forensic features, including the following:
Critical data analysis tools, vibrant charts and graphs, and quick access to raw logs. Sift through tens of thousands of data rows without the hindrance of pagination. An array of grid tools helps reduce the time that you need to make informed determinations about network activities.
Multiple real-time, interchangeable dashboard layouts. You can create and share dashboard layouts to support different information needs.
Dedicated alarm management with SmartResponse action integration and a streamlined interface for viewing, filtering, and sorting alarms.
Collaborative forensic tools for identifying suspicious logs, collecting evidence, and building cases around network activities that appear to be related to the same threat.
User-created saved and shared searches for routine queries.
Direct web access to authorized report packages. Download available reports in PDF format or create and run new searches based on their reporting filters.
Direct web access to browse, view, create, and edit lists used in searches, alarms, and more. Add values to lists directly from the Analyzer grid.
LogRhythm currently supports up to three Web Console instances with 60 concurrent users. However, other usage limitations apply. For more information, see the Web Services Host API information in the Configuration Manager.

The
Get Started with LogRhythm SIEM

"When you are logged in to the Web Console, you can verify its connectivity to the Web Console server. On the upper-right side of the Web Console, a status indicator displays ""Live Data"" with a blue dot next to it. If the Web Console cannot establish a connection, the status indicator displays  ""Reconnecting"" or ""Disconnected."" When the Web Console is connected, any Processing Rate gauges, Trend charts, or Top X controls displayed on the Dashboards page updates automatically, unless you pause the live data stream.


At times, you may want to temporarily pause live data from streaming into the Web Console. For example, if alarms are triggering at a rapid pace, you may want to pause the connection so that new alarms do not push out previous alarms. This allows you time to investigate an issue. When you are ready to receive live data again, you can restart the data connection. All data is queued in the indexer cache and available when you resume.
The pause function is only applicable to the currently displayed page. For example:
If the Alarms page is displayed, the Pause button stops new alarm cards from displaying.
If the Dashboards page is displayed, the Pause button stops live data from updating any processing rate gauges, trend charts, and TopX controls.
To use the Pause and Resume function:
In the upper-right of the screen, near the status indicator, click the
Pause
icon to pause the live data stream.
The icon changes to a Resume icon. No live data is lost. It remains in the indexer cache until you are ready to receive it.
Click the

"LogRhythm AI Engine detects conditions in your deployment that occur over multiple data sources and time ranges. AI Engine can connect the dots to paint a picture that is far more enlightening than its individual parts and reveal potential problems while you still have time to take effective action. It provides realtime visibility to risks, threats, and critical operations issues. There are more than 100 preconfigured rule sets that can be used in the wizard-based drag and drop GUI.
For information on the Risk-Based Priority calculations used with AI Engine Rules, see
Global Risk Based Priority
.
The AI Engine components include:
AI Engine (service on the AI Engine server)
AI Engine Communication Manager (service on the AI Engine server)
AI Engine Data Provider (within the LogRhythm Mediator)

There are three log files that can be reviewed for success, error, and general log messages related to the AI Engine. The number of logs you see depends on the LogLevel that is set in the AI Engine configuration file.
The LRAIEComMgr.log and LRAIEEngine.log files are on the AI Engine Server in the location selected during installation. The default location is C:\Program Files\LogRhythm\LogRhythm AI Engine\logs
The LRAIEDP.log file is on the Data Processor Server in the location selected during installation of the mediator. The default location is C:\Program Files\LogRhythm\LogRhythm Mediator Server\logs

There are several system rules that come packaged with the AI Engine software. The rules must be downloaded and imported using the Knowledge Base Import Wizard. For more information, see
Import a Knowledge Base

The AI Engine Installer installs performance counters for the AI Engine Communication Manager. The Performance Category is called LogRhythm AI Engine Communication Manager, and it consists of the following counters:
The Mediator Installer installs performance counters for the AI Engine Data Provider. LogRhythm AI Engine Data Provider consists of the following counters:


The AI Engine runs the Windows Service LRAIEngine. It receives the logs sent from the AI Engine Communication Manager and applies the AI Engine Rules to process the logs. It generates Events when those rules are satisfied. The AI Engine also provides diagnostic performance data and can save and reload state when it is shut down and restarted.
The AI Engine design uses time-binned aggregated data when it processes logs against the AI Engine rules. Therefore, processing is not affected by the order the data arrives.

AI Engine ComMgr consists of these two parts:
AI Engine Data Provider (AIEDP) located in the Data Processor Mediator.
AIEDP runs on the LogRhythm Mediator and sends logs to the AIEDR in all specified AI Engine servers. It starts and stops along with the Mediator service.
AIEDP configuration data is on the system where the Mediator resides: C:\Program Files\LogRhythm\LogRhythm Mediator Server\config\LRAIEDP.ini
AIEDP writes logs to the following: C:\Program Files\LogRhythm\LogRhythm Mediator Server\logs\LRAIEDP.log

The AI Engine User Interface has an AI Engine Rule Manager that lists the current AI Engine Rules, and an AI Engine Rule Wizard where you create and modify rules.
These screens and other information are described in detail in the AI Engine Rule Manager and the AI Engine Rule Wizard.

AI Engine rule blocks include user-selected time limits to define the time span within which the rule block condition must be met. In multiple-block rules, a time limit may be contingent on a preceding rule block. For example, you can create an event if rule block B (a specific application starts) occurs or does not occur within X minutes after rule block A (the nightly backup finishes) occurs.
Depending on rule properties, you can set a time limit from one of the following locations in the AI Engine Rule Wizard:
Threshold tab
Unique Values tab
Rule Block Relationship window
Rule Block Time pane

AI Engine rules are able to span multiple data sources and time ranges by using up to three separate rule blocks. The AI Engine Rule Wizard provides a means for you to create custom rules. Each rule block has its own specific properties, which are applied in the following order:
Log Source
Day and Time
Primary Criteria
Include Filters
Exclude Filters
The Rule Block Relationship window allows you to identify the common fields shared by two rule blocks and identify any time constraints that one block imposes on the other. For example, you can instruct the second rule block to become effective one hour after the first rule block is satisfied.
Using multiple rule blocks and relationships, the AI Engine can detect situations such as:
A server was attacked and later started transferring large amounts of data out of the network.
A backup started but never finished.
A critical service or system did not restart.
Worm propagation.

The AI Engine Rule Wizard consists of the following tabs:
Rule Blocks
. The Rule Blocks tab is divided into four panes:
Rule Block Types. Used to add new Rule Blocks to an AI Engine Rule. The types are separated into four categories:
Rule Block Designer
. Used to edit the properties of a Rule Block.

Settings. The Settings tab allows you to configure common event properties, alarm properties, and general properties for the AI Engine Rule. When the Sync with rule name box is selected, the Common Event name is synchronized with the rule name. For information on the settings you can configure on the Settings tab, see
Filters—Settings
.
Notify. The Notify tab allows you to designate the Roles, People, and Groups to be notified when a rule has been satisfied. If you are using data segregation to limit alarm notifications to only people who have access to a certain entity, each recipient on this tab must have an associated user profile that grants them access to that entity. For more information, see User Profile Manager and Configure Notifications in the Filter Editor.
Actions. For information on the settings you can configure on the Settings tab, see

When you access the AI Engine Rule Wizard to Create an AI Engine Rule (Complete Guide) or modify one, the Rule Blocks tab appears by default.

An AI Engine rule can include up to three sub-components called rule blocks. Each rule block has its own data source, filter criteria, time frame, and conditions.
All rule blocks continuously receive logs that match their designated data source and filter criteria. The AI Engine periodically checks each block to see if its condition has been detected. When the condition is met, the AI Engine checks related blocks in the rule to see if their conditions are also met. If that happens, an event is generated. An alarm may also be generated depending on the rule configuration.
There are four basic rule block types:
Log
Threshold
Unique Values
Behavioral
Except Behavioral, each type contains three variations:
Observed
Not Observed Compound
Not Observed Scheduled
The variations for Behavioral are: Whitelist, Statistical, and Trend.

The Rule Manager grid includes the following columns. When changing the View from All Rules to a Server, there are some changes to the columns shown.
All Rules
Name of the AI Engine Rule. Max characters = 100
Because rules are identified by ID, the name is not required to be unique. However, use a naming convention that promotes clarity for your deployment.
The AI Engine rule name is automatically assigned to the associated Common Event and Alarm Rule in the format
AIE
: followed by the first 45 characters of the rule name.
Disabled
The rule is not processed. Intended for temporary usage.
When you disable a rule, the in-memory log data supporting that rule is discarded. If you re-enable the rule, the in-memory log data supporting that rule begins to be accumulated again.
Enabled
The rule is processed as normal.
Expired
The rule was configured with an expiration date/time which has passed. The rule is not processed.
Learning
A rule with one or more applicable Behavioral Rule Blocks is accumulating state information. All data is being collected for the rule, but it is not yet being evaluated. When the Activation Date is reached, it goes into the Enabled state.
Paused
A rule has been paused to stop generating New events, but continues to maintain all state data for the rule.
Retired
The rule is not processed and by default does not appear in the grid. Intended for long-range or permanent usage.
Suspended
Rules with errors or which consume too many resources such as memory or CPU time are automatically suspended and are not processed. The Suspend Reason column displays more information. After diagnosing the reason for the suspension, you must re-enable the rule manually to take it out of Suspended status.
When a rule is suspended, the in-memory log data supporting that rule is discarded. If you re-enable the rule, the in-memory log data supporting that rule begins to be accumulated again.
Unassigned
The rule is not assigned to any engine. Either the rule is not in a rule set mapped to a workload or the workload is not assigned to an engine.
Displays the Restart status.
blank: No Restart Required
Restart Needed : Rule has been edited and requires a restart
Restart Pending: Restart button pressed but restart has not yet completed
Date the rule expires if one is set. N/A indicates that no expiration date is associated with this rule.
This cell is selected for expired rules.
Disabled
No Data segregation is in effect.
Entity
All rule processing and events are segregated by the Entity of the logs.
Root Entity
All rule processing and events are segregated by the Root Entity of the logs.
If the Alarm Status column shows Enabled, this column shows Enabled or Disabled.
If the Alarm Status column shows Disabled, this column shows N/A.
[E]nvironmental [D]ependence [F]actor is used in risk calculation and is set on Settings tab of the AI Engine Rule Wizard Tabs. It estimates how much additional configuration is required for the rule to function as expected within different network environments.
Possible values:
None = No additional configuration required.
Low = Minimum additional configuration required.
Medium = Additional configuration required.
High = Significant additional configuration required.
F
alse
P
ositive
P
robability is used in risk calculation and is set on Settings tab of the AI Engine Rule Wizard Tabs. It estimates how likely the rule is to generate a false positive response.
The amount of time repeated events are suppressed. The event associated with this rule is not created more frequently than the value stated here once every 15 minutes for a unique occurrence. For example, if the rule detects server failures, it does not create an event more than once every 15 minutes for a particular server. It can create events more than once every 15 minutes for different servers.
When the rule's alarm is enabled, it is always generated for every event.
Values = Low, Normal, or High.
If the AI Engine begins to run out of memory, it tries to reclaim memory by first reducing excess log grace period then, second, suspending rules starting with the lowest runtime priority.
Best Practice: Start new, untested rules with a Runtime Priority = Low until processing is verified. Set important, well-tested rules to Runtime Priority = High.
System: Global Admin - A System AI Engine Rule can only be created by LogRhythm. It imports in a disabled state and must be enabled by a user that logs in with Global Admin permissions.
Custom: Global Admin - a Custom AI Engine Rule can be created by a user that logs in with Global Admin permissions.
A unique number generated by AI Engine and assigned to an AI Engine Rule.
The first System AI Engine Rule increments from 1.
The first Custom AI Engine Rule increments from 1000000001.

LogRhythm deployments support multiple AI Engine servers providing a horizontally scalable deployment architecture for very large deployments. Each AIE node can receive all or a subset of processed log data. Each AIE node can be assigned a workload that determines which AIE rules it should run.

AIE rule sets allow for the gathering of rules into a group (set) as well as for providing a filter to specify which logs will be sent to the rule set's workload.
A workload specifies all the AIE rules to be in use by a given AIE server, and is comprised of one or more rule sets. If more than one rule set is included in a workload, any log that matches the criteria (filters) specified by at least one of the rule sets is forwarded to that workload's server and is evaluated against all rules in all of the workload's rule sets. As an example, if Rule Set A filters in only logs from Entity A, and Rule Set B filters in only logs from Entity B, and Workload C on Server C includes Rule Sets A and B, all logs coming from Entity A or B go to Server C and are evaluated against both Rule Sets A and B.
The data segregation option in an AIE rule may be used to ensure that a rule is triggered only by logs that all have the same entity or root entity. Data segregation by entity also ensures that alarm notification emails sent by the Notification Service are only sent to recipients who have access to that entity. For the Notification Service to work, the AIE Drill Down Cache must be enabled in the LogRhythm Configuration Manager and TLS 1.2 must be enabled.

"The Global Risk Based Priority (RBP) threshold represents the minimum RBP of events that you want to monitor. The 100-point RBP scale provides a relative measure of an event’s risk to help you prioritize analysis and response efforts. By default, all events are stored online and are searchable, even if they are not forwarded to the Platform Manager according to Global RBP.
There are four fields that let you further customize RBP settings:
AIE RBP Settings
,
Default Destination Risk Level (MPE/AIE)
,
Default Source Threat Level (MPE/AIE)
, and
MPE RBP Settings
. These settings work with the Global RBP to customize the priority of logs coming through, and whether they are treated as Events.


To calculate an overall priority for AIE Events, LogRhythm gathers the following information:
Origin Host (Source) Threat Level (STL): can be known, unknown, or default (internal or external)
Impacted Host (Destination) Risk Level (DRL): can be known, unknown, or default (internal or external)
Origin Network
Impacted Network
AIE Rule
Risk Rating
False Positive Probability
Risk Rating
False Positive Probability
Global Weights for above values
Influencer
Balanced
Rule Risk Rating
Impacted Host
Balanced
Rule Risk Rating
Impacted Host

If the log was resolved to a Known Impacted Host, the Host Risk Level assigned the Host record is used.
DRL = Host Risk Level for Known Impacted Host
DRL = Host Risk Level for Known Impacted Host
If an IP was parsed, network resolution is performed. If a Network is found, the Network Risk Level is used.
DRL = Risk Level of Resolved Network based on Known Impacted Host IP Address
DRL = Risk Level of Resolved Network based on Known Impacted Host IP Address
If a Risk Level cannot be determined via a Known Host or Network
DRL = Default Risk Level as defined in the Platform Manager, in the Global Risk Based Priority section under Default Destination Risk Level (MPE/AIE)
DRL = Default Risk Level as defined in the Platform Manager, in the Global Risk Based Priority section under Default Destination Risk Level (MPE/AIE)

If the log was resolved to a Known Origin Host, the value assigned the Host record for Threat Level is used.
STL = Threat Level for Known Origin Host
STL = Threat Level for Known Origin Host
If an IP was parsed, network resolution is performed. If a Network is found, the Network Risk Level is used.
STL = Risk Level of Resolved Network based on Known Origin Host IP Address
STL = Risk Level of Resolved Network based on Known Origin Host IP Address
If a Risk Rating cannot be determined via a Known Host or Network
STL = Default Threat Level as defined in the Platform Manager, in the Global Risk Based Priority section under Default Source Threat Level (MPE/AIE)
STL = Default Threat Level as defined in the Platform Manager, in the Global Risk Based Priority section under Default Source Threat Level (MPE/AIE)

To calculate an overall priority for MPE Events, LogRhythm gathers the following information:
Origin Host (Source) Threat Level (STL): can be known, unknown, or default (internal or external)
Impacted Host (Destination) Risk Level (DRL): can be known, unknown, or default (internal or external)
Origin Network
Impacted Network
Message Classification
Common Event
Global Weights for the above values

In addition to factors from the log message and MPE/AIE Rules, global RBP settings are also applied. Each factor in the list has a weight value, and there are three different settings for the AIE RBP calculation:
Rule Risk Rating influence
Impacted Host influence
Balanced—a blend of the first two settings
Finally, there are global (internal and external) defaults for the Origin Host and Impacted Host threat and risk levels, as well as fallback methods for setting risk and threat levels. If there is no level set on the host, then risk falls back to the network level. If there is no network level, then risk falls back to the global defaults—internal or external, based on the host address.

DRL
. Host Risk Level represents the amount of risk developed if the system were to become compromised or the subject of some other issue. A value of 0 means no risk is involved in the loss of this system; a value of 9 means the most risk will be incurred if an issue arises. This is relevant when this host is the impacted system, target, or is acted upon by external forces.
STL
. The Host Threat Level designates the amount of threat that is developed if the system were to be the origin of actions. A value of 0 means that actions originating from this host are of little cause for alarm or are possibly commonplace, and a value of 9 means that this system should not be the source of outgoing actions and that there is the greatest threat to security if such events are observed.

DRL
.
Network Risk Level represents the amount of risk developed if the network were to become compromised or the subject of some other issue. A value of 0 means no risk is involved in the loss of this network, a value of 9 means the most risk is incurred if an issue arises. This is relevant when this network is the impacted network, target, or is acted upon by external forces.
STL
. The Network Threat Level designates the degree of threat when the network is the origin of actions. A value of 0 means that actions originating from this network are of little cause for alarm or are possibly commonplace. A value of 9 means that this network should not be the source of outgoing actions and that there is the greatest threat to security if such events are observed.

"The Platform Manager (PM) is the hub of a LogRhythm installation. It serves as the central repository for events, configuration and licensing information, the LogRhythm Knowledge Base, and LogMart. In small deployments, the Platform Manager can also host other LogRhythm components. In larger deployments, it should be a dedicated system. There is only one PM per deployment
The Platform Manager (PM) is a Windows Server system running SQL Server, the LogRhythm Alarming and Response Manager (ARM) service, and the LogRhythm Job Manager service.
The ARM processes alarm rules and takes the appropriate response, such as sending email to people on a notification list.
The Job Manager runs scheduled report jobs and other background functions such as automated List imports and heartbeat monitoring. You can schedule report packages to run and be delivered automatically using the Scheduled Report Job Manager. The Job Manager then creates, exports, notifies, and delivers the reports.

The Platform Manager contains the LogRhythm databases described in the following table.
LogRhythmEMDB
All configuration information for a LogRhythm deployment (entities, hosts, networks, agents, log sources, and so on).
All records of the archive file properties such as physical properties and hash for verification.
All Knowledge Base information that is imported via the KB import process (MPE Rules/Policies, Investigations, Reports, etc.).
N/A
LogRhythm_LogMart
Tables that track unique log messages with aggregated occurrence information for collected log data
Statistics tables that track the volume of log data collected from each log source.
Hour

The Platform Manager windows contains the following four sections:
Alarming, Reporting, and Response Manager Services
,
Job Manager Services
,
System Management Settings
, and
Global Risk Based Priority

"The Alarming and Reporting Manager (ARM) service is a component of the Platform Manager and is responsible for the processing and delivery of all alerts and alarms. The ARM service runs as a Windows service named LogRhythm Alarming and Manager.

The SMTP Server IP Addresses are located in the Platform Manager Properties. They are used to send email notifications. You can specify a primary, secondary, and tertiary server to allow for failover.
Three attempts are made to send each email notification to the IP Address(es) specified.
If one SMTP server is specified, that same server is tried 3 times.
If two SMTP servers are specified, the first is tried, then the second, then the first again.
If three SMTP servers are specified, each is tried once.
If an Email From address is not specified, the Alarming and Reporting Engine is disabled.
Successful or not, a record of all notifications are written to the nfns.log file in the ARM logs folder on the server.

To ensure events aren't processed more than once, the ARM maintains the state in which events have been processed. This information is maintained in a state file located in the state directory where the ARM was installed (...LogRhythm\LogRhythm Alarming and Response Manager\state).
The file is named ARMState.pos. If the state file is removed, the next time the ARM is started, all events are reprocessed.

The ARM logs data to C:\Program Files\LogRhythm\LogRhythm Alarming and Response Manager\logs\scarm.log. When initially configuring and installing the ARM, a LogLevel of Info or Verbose provides detailed information on the ARM performance that is useful in ensuring the system is functioning properly. After the ARM is configured and operating properly, we recommend you set the LogLevel to Error or Warning.
The LogLevel can be set from the
Modify Platform Manager Basic Properties
dialog box.

LogRhythm's Alarming and Response Manager (ARM) allows you to customize alarm rules that are triggered by identified events, and then send out alarm notifications via email and SNMP traps. LogRhythm also can forward alarm notifications to McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator (version 3.6, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.1, or 5.3) where they appear in the Console's Event Log interface. An ePO Administrator or Reviewer can view, filter, sort, and export these events and summarize them in custom charts, tables and ePO dashboards. LogRhythm's ePO notification events are securely transmitted from the LogRhythm Platform Manager server to the ePO server by the McAfee Agent.

Enter a Notification Email Subject Prefix. The default is ""LogRhythm Alarm - "".
In the Notification Period in Minutes and Maximum Notifications Per Period settings, set the amount of notifications to be sent in a specific amount of time.
Setting Notification Period in Minutes to 0 results in all alarms being sent in individual notifications as shown in this example:
WHEN
Notification Period in Minutes = 60
Maximum Notifications Per Period = 10
15 alarms are received in 60 minutes
RESULT
The first 10 alarms notify individually.
The last 5 alarms are sent in a batch notification at the end of 60 minutes.
In the Notification Period in Minutes and Maximum Notifications Per Period settings, set the amount of notifications to be sent in a specific amount of time.
Setting Notification Period in Minutes to 0 results in all alarms being sent in individual notifications as shown in this example:

The last 5 alarms are sent in a batch notification at the end of 60 minutes.
Decide whether to include N/A fields. If Include N/A Fields is selected, the email includes headers for all selected items, even if they are blank. If Include N/A Fields is cleared, selected items that are blank are omitted completely.
Select a Notification Format. The default is HTML.
The AIE Drill Down Cache feature must be enabled for HTML notifications. Note that this feature should only be enabled if you have an average of 10,000 daily alarms or fewer. If your deployment processes more than 10,000 alarms per day, AIE Drilldown Cache performance, as well as overall deployment performance, could be degraded.
For XMs and
single node Linux clusters,
the maximum alarm rate should be 5,000.
You can check your alarm rate in the Client Console's Deployment Monitor. If your alarm rate exceeds 10,000 per day, it is recommended that you disable the AIE Drill Down Cache API in the LogRhythm Configuration Manager or reduce your alarm volume by adjusting your AIE rules.

The Alarming and Response Manager (ARM) evaluates system and user-defined alarm rules to determine whether an Event should incur an alarm. The Alarm Rule Wizard moves you through the process of creating and configuring an alarm rule. You can enable, disable, retire, and restore, alarm rules from the Alarm Rules tab of the Deployment Manager.

There are two types of Security Permissions, System and Custom. System Permissions are created by LogRhythm and come in two types, Global and Private, as defined below. Custom Security Permissions are created by users.
System alarm rules are created by LogRhythm and cannot be removed:
System Global
. Administrators can modify filters and notifications, as well as enable or disable these rules.
If you select Synchronize Alarm Rule Criteria when you import a Knowledge Base file, local modifications that conflict with the synchronization are overwritten.
System Private

The ARM compares new events to active alarm rules. When an Alarm Rule is configured to create Text File notifications, one line of text is appended to the current output file each time the alarm is triggered. Like other alarm notification types, file-based alarm notifications may include alarm values such as the Alarm Rule Name and Alarm Date. Unlike other alarm notification types, it only includes event values for the first event associated with an alarm.
You may see an alarm record for an aggregate alarm rule that shows an Event Count of 3 yet has only one Origin Host value. The ARM appends one line of text to the output file.

To maintain consistency between date values that appear inside the alarm records and in the file name timestamp, all dates are translated to the selected Time Zone. This may result in a discrepancy between the system clock and the timestamp shown in the file name. For example, if the ARM host is in Mountain Time (UTC-07:00) and the Time Zone selected in the Text File Notification Policy is UTC, then daily rollover will occur at or after 12:00 AM UTC, which is 5:00 PM MST. Although the new file may be created at 5:00:35 PM local time, the timestamp as shown here is in UTC time: LogRhythmAlarms20101116_000035_8347937.txt

When UTF-8 Text Encoding is selected, the ARM automatically writes the Byte Order Mark (BOM) to the beginning of the file. For example, BareTail displays the mark as a special character at the beginning of the file, but correctly recognizes the text encoding as UTF-8.

Data format used by Text File Notification is identical to the data formatting used by the LogRhythm Log Exporter:
Integers:
Integer values are region-invariant (the format doesn’t change from region to region).
Commas and/or periods are not used.
Example: 1935
Integer values are region-invariant (the format doesn’t change from region to region).
Commas and/or periods are not used.

Decimals:

The format is always #0.#########.
Examples: 0.3474304 or 84627.34545

If the ARM cannot write to the output file, it automatically rolls over and attempts to create a new output file. This may happen if a program such as Notepad opens the file with write access. If the ARM cannot write to an output file after three attempts, then it logs an error and stops trying.
Some reasons that Text File Notification might fail all three attempts are:
One or more directories in the specified Base File Path cannot be found.
The ARM process does not have permission to create and/or write files in the specified directory.
One or more directories in the specified Base File Path cannot be found.
The ARM process does not have permission to create and/or write files in the specified directory.

The Alarm Notification Policy is used to specify information that is included in an Alarm Notification, as well as throttle the number of notifications in an allotted time.

The Alarming and Response Manager is capable of sending alarm notification in several ways, each with a unique type of Notification Policy. People and roles may be assigned contact methods using the available policy types.
SMTP
. Used for creating policies that notify users via email. This is the only notification type that can be used for receiving AI Engine Drill Down Cache results.
SMTP notifications can be text or HTML. Only HTML notifications include the Rule Block section and Origin/Impacted section. The Rule Block sections provides data according to both Group By Fields and AIE Summary Fields. HTML notifications also show log messages, rather than the AIE Event XML. Note:
The AIE Drill Down Cache feature must be enabled for HTML notifications. Both the AIE Drill Down Cache API and the Notification Service settings can be modified in the Configuration Manager.

The LogRhythm Job Manager is a Windows service that is a component of the Platform Manager. The following are the main responsibilities of the Job Manager:

Administrators may opt to configure LogRhythm to synchronize user and group information from AD for the purposes of data contextualization and correlation tasks.
AD Synchronization
can be performed through a regularly scheduled synchronization process via the Job Manager or as a manual process using the AD Synchronization Tool. The Job Manager service performs scheduled AD Synchronization with these conditions:
Synchronization starts five minutes after the Job Manager service starts.
Synchronization occurs every hour if the Job Manager service is running.
The Job Manager attempts to synchronize three times after experiencing an error before waiting for the next scheduled synchronization.
The service the Job Manager runs under must have the permissions required to query AD to avoid permission related errors.
Only domains that have Include in Sync selected are synchronized.
Along with Active Directory Synchronization, Job Manager also performs Active Directory group-based authorization synchronization.

The LogRhythm Knowledge Base is a package containing many of the system default settings for MPE Rules, Message Source Types, Platforms, Log Processing Policies, System AIE Rules, System Alarm Rules, Report Templates, and Compliance Packages. Knowledge Base Synchronization is scheduled in the KB Manager in the Client Console. If the Job Manager is running, the service will try to update and
synchronize the Knowledge Base
at scheduled time.

Reports are created and managed from Client Console. Reports are scheduled in form of Report Packages, which are collections of reports. When
reports are scheduled from Client Console
, the Job Manager executes that scheduled job by creating, exporting, notifying parties, and delivering the reports.

The Job Manager List Import task runs continuously, polling at frequent intervals for list file changes. If a file with the correct name appears,
the task imports the list
. After a file has been successfully imported, it is deleted. If an error occurs during import, it is renamed with a suffix of .bad. The status of each list import attempt is written to the log file and event log.
The following default rules apply:
The default import directory is config\list_import (relative to the Job Manager install folder).
The default processing interval is 60 seconds.
The defaults cannot be changed.

The Job Manager makes database calls for
list items that are configured to expire
and marks them as expired at the appropriate time.

The Job Manager
monitors the heartbeat
of Mediators, System Monitor Agents, Log Sources, the AIE Communication Manager, the AIE Engine, and Network Montors. The Job Manager interacts with each component's state file and database information to get the component's heartbeat information.

"The Active Directory Domain Manager window contains a grid to list the domains and subdomains that have been previously added for synchronization. The following table describes the columns in the grid.
The organizational unit for the domain. Used for Windows Host Wizard scanning.
The Organizational Unit should be entered in the following format:
ABCCompany/computers/servers/OUName
There are two menu items available: New and Properties. The OK, Cancel, and Apply buttons appear at the bottom of the window.
The actions in the following table can be accessed by right-clicking the grid area.

LogRhythm provides a regularly scheduled synchronization process to retrieve data from Active Directory and store it in the LogRhythm EMDB. After synchronization, you can access and filter the data using the following tools: Investigations, Tails, Reports, Personal Dashboard, Alarm Rule Criteria, SecondLook restore criteria, and Log Distribution Service (LDS) Policy criteria. You can also view the data from the Active Directory Browsers accessible via the Client Console.
LogRhythm administrators are able to manage LogRhythm users in the same manner as Active Directory users. This allows the administrators to put Active Directory users into the LogRhythm system based on their active directory.
Active Directory Group Based Authorization requires the Platform Manager to be a Domain member to function correctly.
Synchronization of Active Directory objects follows these rules:
After a Group or User has been created in the local database, it is never deleted.
All Users must be synced or synchronization fails. Each user is synced independently. If failure occurs, all users synced prior to failure will have been updated in the database.
User Login Values: three login values are stored for each user and represent possible AD login strings:
[Username] (i.e., pete). Saved in IDMUser.Login1.
[Username]@[FQDN] (i.e.,
test@abcd.something.com
). Saved in IDMUser.Login2.
[NetBIOS Name]\[Username] (i.e., something\john). Saved in IDMUser.Login3.
This format is only saved for root level domains. It is not saved for sub-domains because sub-domains may have the same NetBIOS name as the parent domain.
Only login 1-3 fields are synchronized, login4 and login5 are not synced. Users can manually input values into these fields and they would be filtered on.
[Username] (i.e., pete). Saved in IDMUser.Login1.
[Username]@[FQDN] (i.e.,
test@abcd.something.com
). Saved in IDMUser.Login2.
[NetBIOS Name]\[Username] (i.e., something\john). Saved in IDMUser.Login3.
This format is only saved for root level domains. It is not saved for sub-domains because sub-domains may have the same NetBIOS name as the parent domain.

All Groups must be synced or sync fails. Each group is synced independently. If failure occurs, all groups synced prior to failure will have been updated in the database.
Group membership is synced to reflect membership at time of sync. All group members must be successfully updated or no changes are made for that group. Group membership is updated within a transaction. If any failure occurs when updating a single group, no changes for that group are updated in the database. However, groups having membership synced prior to failure will have been updated in the database.

Active Directory Synchronization is required for the Windows Host Wizard to identify computers and for the Active Directory Group Authorization in the User Profile to identify users. The following permissions are required for Active Directory Synchronization.
Ports must be enabled for the LDAP environment. To determine the ports required for your specific LDAP environment, see
Active Directory and Active Directory Domain Services Port Requirements
. Most deployments will require TCP and UDP 389.
LDAP and Secure LDAP requires a trust relationship with remote domains to validate and synchronize. While
Trust over LDAPS (LDAP with SSL) can be established with certs without having to set up an actual trust relationship, this configuration is currently not supported.
The service account must have read permissions for the Job Manager.
The service the Job Manager runs under must have the permissions required to query Active Directory to avoid permission-related errors.

The domains are synchronized hourly. Domains must exist in the list and at least one must have Include in Sync or Include in Group Based Authorization checked in the appropriate column.
Synchronizing updates the LogRhythm deployment with the current users, groups, and group members in Active Directory. All domains where Include In Sync or Include in Group Based Authorization are checked will be synchronized.
The synchronization process does not delete users or groups because they might be referred to by log, event, and alarm records.

The Job Manager service performs scheduled Active Directory Synchronization with these conditions:
Synchronization starts five minutes after the Job Manager service starts.
Synchronization occurs every hour as long as the Job Manager service is running.
The Job Manager attempts to synchronize three times after experiencing an error before waiting for the next scheduled synchronization.
The service the Job Manager runs under must have the permissions required to query AD to avoid permission related errors.
Only domains that have Include In Sync selected are synchronized.

There are two Active Directory browsers, both accessible under Knowledge on the Tools menu. The browsers provide a means to access the existing Active Directory information that has been synchronized and stored in the LogRhythm EMDB. However, users who are limited to Restricted Admin or Restricted Analyst roles do not have access to view Active Directory group or user membership information in these browsers.

The Active Directory User Browser has two grids. The top grid contains all users who have been synchronized as part of the AD Synchronization process that stores the AD information in the LogRhythm EMDB. The lower grid lists the groups to which the user belongs.

The Active Directory Group Browser has three grids. The top grid contains all groups that have been synchronized as part of the AD Synchronization process that stores the AD information in the LogRhythm EMDB. The lower-left grid lists the members of the group. The lower-right grid contains the user information for members of the group.

Administrators can enable global options that override settings at the Data Processor, Log Source, and MPE Policy levels. Global settings are applicable in both Classification Based and Standard Data Management configurations.
Data Management profiles simplify configuration based on the deployment's data management model. Data Management settings have been pre-packaged into configurations which support various deployment models and uses of the product.
Collection Optimized
Search Optimized
Performance Optimized
Custom
You have the option to manage these settings at a more granular level.
Global Data Management Settings are:
a simpler way to configure and understand how LogRhythm manages log data.
a global mechanism for configuring data management that does not require you to manage key settings in numerous places.
a straightforward way to implement global data management overrides and event forwarding.
powerful enough to enable data management configuration at the Data Processor, Log Source, and MPE Policy levels for advanced users.

In many deployments, it is not feasible to keep all log data indexed or online. The system must be tuned so only a subset of data is indexed in your Data Processor(s) while ensuring the right data is indexed. Intelligent Indexing automates and simplifies tuning where LogRhythm automatically indexes the data known to be needed versus requiring manual and complex tuning.
The following items have their log data indexed (i.e. brought online) into the applicable data source (Data Processor and/or LogMart):
Reports
Report Packages
Tails
Investigations
The Global Log Processing Rules supersede Intelligent Indexing settings and can be used to take specific data offline.
The following performance counters monitor Intelligent Indexing:
Intelligent Indexing Data Processor % Indexed
. The percentage of logs processed against Data Processor Intelligent Indexing rules which matched a rule.
Intelligent Indexing LogMart % Indexed
. The percentage of logs processed against LogMart Intelligent Indexing rules which matched a rule.
Intelligent Indexing Processing Rate
. Intelligent Indexing Processing Rate

Data Management settings require site-specific modifications for global configuration. Global system settings include Identity Inference, which can help recognize the user responsible for an activity when identity information, such as account or login, is not available in the log message. Using an inference model, the identity associated with logs containing applicable host information, such as IP addresses, can be determined. This feature maintains a mapping of users to hosts based on log activity observed. When this feature is enabled, the Message Processing Engine performs the identify inference.

The Active Directory Domain Manager window contains a grid to list the domains and subdomains that have been previously added for synchronization. The following table describes the columns in the grid.
There are two menu items available: New and Properties. The OK, Cancel, and Apply buttons appear at the bottom of the window.
The actions in the following table can be accessed by right-clicking the grid area.

LogRhythm provides a regularly scheduled synchronization process to retrieve data from Active Directory and store it in the LogRhythm EMDB. After synchronization, you can access and filter the data using the following tools: Investigations, Tails, Reports, Personal Dashboard, Alarm Rule Criteria, SecondLook restore criteria, and Log Distribution Service (LDS) Policy criteria. You can also view the data from the Active Directory Browsers accessible via the Client Console.
LogRhythm administrators are able to manage LogRhythm users in the same manner as Active Directory users. This allows the administrators to put Active Directory users into the LogRhythm system based on their active directory.
Synchronization of Active Directory objects follows these rules:
After a Group or User has been created in the local database, it is never deleted.
All Users must be synced or synchronization fails. Each user is synced independently. If failure occurs, all users synced prior to failure will have been updated in the database.
User Login Values: three login values are stored for each user and represent possible AD login strings:
[Username] (i.e., pete). Saved in IDMUser.Login1.
[Username]@[FQDN] (i.e.,
test@abcd.something.com
). Saved in IDMUser.Login2.
[NetBIOS Name]\[Username] (i.e., something\john). Saved in IDMUser.Login3.
This format is only saved for root level domains. It is not saved for sub-domains because sub-domains may have the same NetBIOS name as the parent domain.
Only login 1-3 fields are synchronized, login4 and login5 are not synced. Users can manually input values into these fields and they would be filtered on.
[Username] (i.e., pete). Saved in IDMUser.Login1.
[Username]@[FQDN] (i.e.,
test@abcd.something.com
). Saved in IDMUser.Login2.
[NetBIOS Name]\[Username] (i.e., something\john). Saved in IDMUser.Login3.
This format is only saved for root level domains. It is not saved for sub-domains because sub-domains may have the same NetBIOS name as the parent domain.
Only login 1-3 fields are synchronized, login4 and login5 are not synced. Users can manually input values into these fields and they would be filtered on.

Only login 1-3 fields are synchronized, login4 and login5 are not synced. Users can manually input values into these fields and they would be filtered on.
All Groups must be synced or sync fails. Each group is synced independently. If failure occurs, all groups synced prior to failure will have been updated in the database.
Group membership is synced to reflect membership at time of sync. All group members must be successfully updated or no changes are made for that group. Group membership is updated within a transaction. If any failure occurs when updating a single group, no changes for that group are updated in the database. However, groups having membership synced prior to failure will have been updated in the database.

Active Directory Synchronization is required for the Windows Host Wizard to identify computers and for the Active Directory Group Authorization in the User Profile to identify users. The following permissions are required for Active Directory Synchronization.
Ports must be enabled for the LDAP environment. To determine the ports required for your specific LDAP environment, see
Active Directory and Active Directory Domain Services Port Requirements
. Most deployments will require TCP and UDP 389.
The service account must have read permissions for the Job Manager.
The service the Job Manager runs under must have the permissions required to query Active Directory to avoid permission-related errors.

The domains are synchronized hourly. Domains must exist in the list and at least one must have Include in Sync or Include in Group Based Authorization checked in the appropriate column.
Synchronizing updates the LogRhythm deployment with the current users, groups, and group members in Active Directory. All domains where Include In Sync or Include in Group Based Authorization are checked will be synchronized.
The synchronization process does not delete users or groups because they might be referred to by log, event, and alarm records.

The Job Manager service performs scheduled Active Directory Synchronization with these conditions:
Synchronization starts five minutes after the Job Manager service starts.
Synchronization occurs every hour as long as the Job Manager service is running.
The Job Manager attempts to synchronize three times after experiencing an error before waiting for the next scheduled synchronization.
The service the Job Manager runs under must have the permissions required to query AD to avoid permission related errors.
Only domains that have Include In Sync selected are synchronized.

There are two Active Directory browsers, both accessible under Knowledge on the Tools menu. The browsers provide a means to access the existing Active Directory information that has been synchronized and stored in the LogRhythm EMDB. However, users who are limited to Restricted Admin or Restricted Analyst roles do not have access to view Active Directory group or user membership information in these browsers.
The Active Directory User Browser has two grids. The top grid contains all users who have been synchronized as part of the AD Synchronization process that stores the AD information in the LogRhythm EMDB. The lower grid lists the groups to which the user belongs.
The Active Directory Group Browser has three grids. The top grid contains all groups that have been synchronized as part of the AD Synchronization process that stores the AD information in the LogRhythm EMDB. The lower-left grid lists the members of the group. The lower-right grid contains the user information for members of the group.

The check box is unchecked by default (recommended setting).
Only Sync Additional Properties for Disabled Rules
Only synchronize advanced settings when the
AI Engine
Rule is disabled.
Disable Dynamic Sync Settings Universally
Manage all dynamic sync rules manually instead of allowing LogRhythm to update them for you as the module content changes. Manual settings persist after Knowledge Base synchronization. Deselecting this setting does not change settings on existing modules. This feature is turned on by default, but most modules are not configured for Dynamic Sync. Modules that are configured to allow Dynamic Sync are determined by LogRhythm.
Alarm Rule Properties
Log Source List Criteria
Synchronize the Log Source Criteria for all system Alarm Rules that use Log Source Lists.
Primary Criteria and Filter Criteria
Synchronize the Primary Criteria, Include Filters and Exclude Filters for all Alarm Rules with System: Global Admin permission.

Common Events (Recommended)
Log Source List Criteria
Log Source List Criteria
AI Engine Rule Properties
For a detailed explanation of these settings, see
AI Engine Rule Properties
.


By default, the List Source List Criteria check box is unchecked. The following table explains the synchronization behavior for each check box option.
The Log Sources and Log Source Lists are not synchronized from the Knowledge Base (wherever Log Source List and Log Source is used) and keep the current values.

The Enable Advanced Synchronization Settings check box controls an AI Engine Rule's advanced settings on the Settings tab in the AI Engine Rule Wizard, including:
Expiration Date
Rule Group
Permissions
Run Time Priority
Rule Set ID
Suppression Seconds
False Positive Probability
Data Segregation Mode
Enable Event Forwarding

By default, the Enable Advanced Synchronization Settings check box is unchecked. Also by default, the
Only sync additional properties for disabled setting is grayed out and not applied. The following table explains the synchronization behavior for the available check box combinations.
All user advanced settings for system rules are preserved.
All system rules are updated to match the advanced settings in the Knowledge Base.
This setting is not recommended on an active deployment because the Rule Set ID will be reset to the default value of 0. This can cause rules to be unassigned from an AI Engine, which causes rules to be disabled.
Use this setting only if you want to intentionally reset all rules to match the Knowledge Base.

"The Knowledge Base (KB) consists of a Core Base Module and individual KB modules. The KB Core Base Module must be installed and updated on all deployments. Then, each individual KB module must be updated to meet the organization's needs.
Each KB module is organized around a single theme or purpose. For example, KB modules are used in the following scenarios:
Compliance Modules (FIM, PCI, NERC CIP, etc.)
Operations Modules
Security Modules
The Knowledge Base Wizard can be run in two cases:
In a new deployment, as part of the New Deployment Wizard.
From the Client Console, during periodic Knowledge Base updates.
Information and downloads for all Knowledge Base modules are available under Documentation & Downloads on the
LogRhythm Community
.

The Common Event (CE) Change Manager was introduced to consolidate Common Events to support easier search, reporting, and AI Engine rules. If custom objects reference a consolidated Common Event, that object may no longer function properly. Impacted custom objects include: Saved Investigations, Saved Tails, Personal Dashboard Filters, Reports, Alarm Rules, GLPRs, AI Engine Rules, MPE Rules, and Common Event Lists.
With the Common Event Change Manager, you can make the appropriate updates based on user input for common events that have been modified.
When the KB is updated, all the new Common Events are added to the CommonEvents table, and the original Common Events are left in place. The rules that assigned the old Common Events to a specific log have been changed to assign the new Common Events.

Here is a Common Event Filter containing two common events:
VPN Authentication
VPN-Authentication - Admin
In this example, the VPN Authentication and VPN Authentication – Admin Common Events were both migrated to User Logon.
If you select Common Event to Common Event, the resulting list of Common Events in the filter are:
VPN Authentication
VPN-Authentication - Admin
User Logon
The old Common Events are left in the filter so that an operation including historic logs would catch the logs with those Common Events. The new Common Events are added to the filter to catch current logs.
VPN Authentication
VPN-Authentication - Admin
User Logon
The old Common Events are left in the filter so that an operation including historic logs would catch the logs with those Common Events. The new Common Events are added to the filter to catch current logs.
If you select Common Event to MPE Rule, the Common Event filter is removed and an MPERule filter that contains all the rules that referred to the OLD Common Events is inserted in its place. The result would be an MPE Rule filter containing the following MPE Rules:
MS-SysLog EVID 20142 : Successful VPN Auth
MID 139 : VPN Client Authentication
Login Packet
MIA: ID 0406 MUVPN User Logged In
ID 013299601: SSL Authentication
ID 013299601: SSL Authentication
SSL-VPN ID-1: User Login Successful
%AUTH-6-41: VPN Authentication
Login Succeeded : VPN Authentication
ASA-6-716038 : WebVPN Authentication Success
VMID 400 : VPN Authentication
ID 013299601: SSL Authentication
MID 235 : VPN Admin Login
VMID 403 : Administrator Authentication
MS-SysLog EVID 20142 : Successful VPN Auth
MID 139 : VPN Client Authentication
Login Packet
MIA: ID 0406 MUVPN User Logged In
ID 013299601: SSL Authentication
ID 013299601: SSL Authentication
SSL-VPN ID-1: User Login Successful
%AUTH-6-41: VPN Authentication
Login Succeeded : VPN Authentication
ASA-6-716038 : WebVPN Authentication Success
VMID 400 : VPN Authentication
ID 013299601: SSL Authentication
MID 235 : VPN Admin Login
VMID 403 : Administrator Authentication

Let’s say you already have a Common Event filter using the User Logon Common Event in a report, investigation, GLPR, or something else. In the 201 KB, there are 72 rules that have User Logon as a Common Event. In the 203 KB, there are 728 rules that have User Logon as a Common Event.
If you do not migrate any configuration items, you have 728 rules that assign a common event of User Logon instead of just 72. The potential to have many more items matching the Common Event filter of User Logon when performing Investigations, running Tails, or running Reports, is huge. This also affects GLPRs, as many more items will match the GLPR.
Here, 111 individual Common Events were migrated from their original value to User Logon. If you migrate using Common Event to Common Event, 111 old Common Events that were something else are now also User Logon, and therefore match the User Logon Common Event Filter. This is another case where performing operations no longer returns only the data you are looking for.
Because using the Common Event to MPE Rule option replaces the original common event with the MPE rule(s) that called it, all the rules that refer to the new Common Event are not included in the filter. In this example, 14 rules are called the VPN Authentication or VPN Authentication – Admin Common Events. Those same 14 rules now call the User Logon Common Event. Using those 14 rules as a filter retains the original intent of the filter and retrieves the OLD and NEW Common Events, whereas using the new Common Event for the filter does not.

"The purpose of this document is to assist the community of LogRhythm administrators and users in getting the most out of LogRhythm Support. Your LogRhythm Support Concierge Team has constructed the document for you, and asks that you make it your own by modifying your copy over time based on your experiences with LogRhythm Support.

LogRhythm offers two support levels: Enhanced Support and Standard Support. The table below shows the coverage hours and initial target response (ITR) times.
Enhanced Support provides 24x7 coverage for Critical and High cases only. Medium and Low cases are serviced during local support region hours. For case priority levels, see
Appendix A: Case Priority
.


For fastest support during business hours, please call our Support Line. The numbers are:

Alternatively, you may submit a case at any time via the LogRhythm Support Portal at
https://support.logrhythm.com
. If a response to your case is urgently required, please also feel free to call the support line after you’ve submitted the case and ask to be transferred to a support engineer right away. If possible, we’ll accommodate you.

We recommend that, at least a day or two before you might need Support, you visit the Portal home page (
https://logrhythmcommunity.force.com/CustomSelfRegister
) to create your account and then contact your LogRhythm Customer Relations Manager (CRM) to ask them to authorize access for you to the Support Portal.

If you have
Enhanced Support
, we suggest that you use the 24x7 telephone numbers exclusively.
For case priority levels, see
Appendix A: Case Priority
.


The Enhanced Support contract gives you the flexibility to contact our support team on any day, at any time, 24/7/365. If you have an Enhanced Support contract, please read this entire section to be sure you understand how to utilize this feature.
If you come to the end of a working session with a support engineer and you wish to resume work with another support engineer in the next available region, tell your support engineer. You will need to let the engineer know whom we should contact to continue the work. Please note:
We cannot guarantee that a support engineer will immediately be available in the next region.
Many times it is more beneficial to stay with the support engineer with whom you’ve been working rather than transferring to another engineer who will need to study the case history before being able to help you.
Whether you call our Support Line or submit a new case through the Support Portal, our weekend staff will be notified and will make every effort to reach back out to you within two hours for Critical cases or four hours for High cases.
Updates to existing cases will NOT notify our weekend staff. So please call the Support Line to record a message in the voice mail system, and remember to include your support case number. Our weekend support team will be notified immediately, will update your case with the information you provided, and will respond to you as soon as possible to continue working with you.

If you have a case open for a particular issue, please do not open another case for that same issue.
If you’re unhappy with the progress on a case, the responsiveness of the engineer, or the engineer in general, please call our Support Line and express your concern to the Concierge.
If, in the course of working on a case, it becomes evident that the title (summary field) is no longer appropriate, please ask the support engineer to change the title.
When you experience a product issue, please refrain from restarting services or rebooting systems as a means of restoring operations until a support engineer has been able to observe the problem and collect relevant data.

Please don’t hesitate to ask your support engineer at the end of a work session what the action plan is. That is, be sure you know what will be done next, by whom, and by when.
Please watch for updates to your cases in your email inbox, or by checking the Support Portal.
When a LogRhythm Support Engineer sends you a message through your support case, the case management system automatically will send you an
additional
email message to notify you that somebody updated your case. If you would prefer not to receive that extra message:
On the Support Portal homepage, select
My Settings
from the pulldown menu next to your name at the top right of the page.
Locate the “Email Notifications” section and uncheck the boxes by “Comments on my posts” and “Comments after me.” This will
not
impact your Community settings.

After receiving a case update, please respond as quickly as you can so that we may continue to work with you. You're welcome to respond to case emails directly, though it is helpful to the LogRhythm Support Team if you reply through the portal instead. Two important tips for you in working with your case on the portal:
When you reply through the portal, we recommend that you provide your update in the top right box labeled ""Post"". It's easier to track the discussion this way than to have nested comments.
Under the ""Post"" box, there's a sorting menu. It's labeled with your current choice, either ""Most Recent Activity"" or ""Latest Posts"". We recommend you set it to ""Most Recent Activity.""

If you call LogRhythm Support during business hours, one of our Support Concierges will answer your call. The Concierge will create your new support case for you, gather all necessary information from you and if possible transfer your call to an appropriate support engineer to begin work with you immediately.
If you submit a case through the portal, or if you called but could not be transferred, your case will be placed into the appropriate support queue. We will do our best to have one of our support engineers contact you within four business hours to begin work.

Please be sure to include the following information in each case you submit. The more accurate and thorough you are, the better we will be able to route your case to the right person and the better that person will be able to address your issue quickly and effectively.
Correct LogRhythm product
Correct product version
If you have different versions for different components involved in the issue, please indicate that in the details of your request.
Correct topic
Accurate priority
Please help us to help you best by indicating the priority fairly. For more information about case priority, please see
Appendix A: Case Priority
.
Summary: think of this as the title of your support case. This should tell us at a glance what problem you’re observing or question you’re asking.
In the Details field, indicate:
whether, how, and how much the problem is impacting your business.
exactly what problem you’ve observed or question you need answered. Remember to let us know when the problem occurred. Please provide as many relevant details as possible, such as specific alarms, log sources, agents, reports, and other items that were involved.
what has changed in your environment in the hours or days leading up to the problem.
whether, how, and how much the problem is impacting your business.
exactly what problem you’ve observed or question you need answered. Remember to let us know when the problem occurred. Please provide as many relevant details as possible, such as specific alarms, log sources, agents, reports, and other items that were involved.
what has changed in your environment in the hours or days leading up to the problem.
If you have a good idea which product component or components are having trouble, please attach to your case the appropriate log files (see
Appendix B: Log Collecting
). Be sure the log files have logs from at least a couple of hours before the problem was observed all the way through to the present, or the time when the problem went away.

This table is intended as a guide to understanding the appropriate setting of priorities for LogRhythm Support cases. Your selection of a priority will assist LogRhythm Support in serving you better, but will not guarantee any specific response or resolution times outside of what is specified in your LogRhythm maintenance contract.

"Lists provide a mechanism for organizing and saving common search criteria used within filters throughout the Application, such as within Investigations, Reports, Alarm Rules, and AI Engine Rules. While many lists are provided by LogRhythm Labs, you can create custom lists for public or private use, and you can publish lists without displaying their contents.

You can create a list of SuperUsers and publish it without displaying the contents of the list. An analyst can use the list in an investigation to see if any SuperUser accounts were utilized within a specified time period on specified hosts.
You can create a list of unauthorized software processes. This list can be applied to servers and workstations where LogRhythm Process Monitoring is enabled to detect unauthorized software use.
You can create a list of countries to which inbound network communications should never be allowed. This list can be used in an AI Engine rule to detect inbound connections through the firewall from suspicious locations.

List Types are associated with field filters in alarms, searches, and reports. To add a list to a filter, the list type must match the field filter. The following table includes a summary of:
List Types
. The metadata field for the list.
Item Types
. The field values that can be used for that type of list.
Filter Types Supported
. The fields within the filter selection that are supported for the list type. This means that if you select a field within the filter drop down, any lists with the associated list type appear.

Use contexts are used specifically with the General Value list type. They provide the system with the filter types supported for the General Value list created. This allows the filtering within the Analysis Tools to know what lists should appear for the selected field.
This table shows the Use Context types and associated Filter Types that are supported.
For example, if you select the Process Use Context type for a General Value list, when you perform a filter using the Process field, the General Value list created appears in the list selector.

Some list types allow for multi-type lists including Application, Hosts, and Users. These list types allow the user to add values for multiple fields related to its type. When these fields are selected for filtering from within an Analysis Tool, any lists associated with their type can be selected.
Application
. The following fields can be used to add values to an Application list:
Impacted Known Application
TCP/UDP Port (Impacted)
TCP/UDP Port Range (Impacted)
Protocol
Host
. The following fields can be used to add values to a Host list:
Known Host
IP Address
IP Address Range
Hostname
User
. The following fields can be used to add values to a User list. This includes values that are associated with the Account and Origin Login fields.
Username
Active Directory Group
You can add a list of specific users by typing in values or you can add a list of users associated with an active directory group.

Lists are flexible enough to allow you to add a list to another list of a compatible type. The added list is called a sub list. This enables you to create sub lists with elements that are to be shared by other lists, rather than having to manage the duplicated items across several lists.
Lists that can contain other lists raise the possibility of loops, where a nested sub list could ultimately reference an outer containing list. The system makes certain that when lists are processed (such as in creating filters) that each list is only processed once.
The following are not checked:
For nested lists, permission and visibility compatibility is not checked. So, for example, it is possible to add a Private list to a Public list.
For nested General Value lists, compatibility of the Use Contexts is not checked.

All users have access to lists. The permissions can be set to limit access to specific lists.
There are two types of Security Permissions: Custom and System. Custom Security Permissions are created by users. System Permissions are created by LogRhythm and come in two flavors, Private and Public. System Lists are imported with the Knowledge Base. The Knowledge Base Module must be enabled and the module synchronized to see the system list in the list manager. For details on modules, see
Knowledge Base Manager
.
The Security Permissions are described in the following table.
List Security is controlled by Read, Write, and Restricted Read attributes, which are described in the following table.
This controls who can see and use a List, and indirectly controls other permissions. Everyone can create Private lists (the default.)
A Global Administrator can assign any permission.
A Restricted Administrator can assign Public Analyst permissions
A Global Analyst can assign Public or Global Analyst.
Restricted Analysts can only assign Public.
System Lists cannot be Private.
Only the list owner or an Admin can change this value.
This can be set to any value consistent with the Read Permissions.
For System: Private Lists this value is Private and cannot be changed.
For System: Public Lists this value is Admins and cannot be changed.

The List Manager lets you view and manage lists in LogRhythm, including the ability to add and retire lists. Lists are available (with appropriate security permissions) to all users. The menu buttons on the List Manager, from left to right, include Properties, Refresh, and New. The file menu options related to lists include Properties, New, and Clone. The following table describes the columns in the grid of the List Manager.
The total number of items and lists that the list contains. If a list contains 10 items and two lists and the Entry Count for the list is 12. The Entry Count value appears for all lists, even if a list is used as a sub list elsewhere in the system.
The List Manager highlights system lists that do not contain any items, indicating that the system list has not been populated. Empty custom lists are not highlighted.

Lists can be imported by the Job Manager using an automated protocol. The lists follow the same rules as the List Properties Editor and File/Clipboard Import (for details on the rules, see
Create Lists in the Client Console
). The Job Manager List Import task runs continuously, polling at frequent intervals for List file changes. If a file with the correct name appears, the task imports the list. The task waits on a writer to the file. It requires exclusive access to the file. After a file has been successfully imported, it is deleted. If an error occurs during import, it is renamed with a suffix of .bad. The status of each list import attempt is written to the log file and event log. The following default rules apply:
The default import directory is config\list_import, relative to the path specified in the Configuration File Parent Directory field in the Job Manager Configuration Manager.
The default processing interval is 60 seconds.
The defaults cannot be changed.

Under certain circumstances, list items are only needed on a temporary basis. For example, when an employee leaves the company, the IT department might want to monitor the employee's account for 90 days for any activity. Instead of having to manually remove the list item, it can be configured to be automatically removed in 90 days. The time span configured for expiring list items is counted from the time of the list's creation into the future. For example, if a Terminated User Account list was created on March 2nd at 12:00 PM with an expiration time of 10 days, all of the list items entered in the list expire at the same time. The last configured time span is saved when the list is saved. If new items are added to the list 5 days after it was saved, the new list items expire in 10 days from the current day. If the intention was to add more items to the list that needed to expire on the same day as the original items, the day field and the hours and minutes field have to be adjusted before the new items are added to the list.

"The Knowledge Base Manager is a tool for managing Knowledge Base Modules and their associated objects. Modules and their associated objects are imported with a Knowledge Base. For details regarding the import process, see
Import a Knowledge Base
.
The Knowledge Base Manager can only be accessed when all other windows in the Client Console are closed.

The Knowledge Base Module and Objects architecture provides administrators flexibility and ease in managing objects within their deployment, including:
The flexibility to import and synchronize only those modules (and their associated objects) that are relevant to the organization. This is managed through the enable and disable functionality of the module.
The flexibility for administrators to choose if the module should be updated based on the latest LogRhythm module and objects (import by default), or if the module should remain as it is in the current deployment (do not import by default).
Ease in identifying which modules are out of sync with LogRhythm’s latest version by viewing the Latest and Loaded version values for the module.
Ease in identifying the specific LogRhythm objects as well as providing others the list of objects for a given module.
Ability to modify the modules that are enabled and imported and synchronized from within the Knowledge Base Importer before the import begins.


Knowledge Base Modules are prepackaged, customizable content applicable to a specific regulation or need, such as reports, investigations, alerts, AI Engine rules, or other applicable product areas. For example, the module named Compliance: NERC CIP contains objects for Alarm Rules, Investigations, Lists, Reports, and Report Packages that are useful in providing information necessary to meet NERC CIP requirements.
The LogRhythm Required Objects module is a module that is required for every deployment to function properly. Required modules are always imported and synchronized with every Knowledge Base import and are not editable by administrators.
The Knowledge Base Modules grid allows you to review existing KB modules and modify their status and synchronization settings. In this grid, you can perform the following actions:
View and edit properties for a module
Enable or disable a module
Export the grid information to a file, including:
Primary objects in the module
Dependent objects in the module
Primary and dependent objects in the module
Primary objects in the module
Dependent objects in the module
Primary and dependent objects in the module
The Knowledge Base Modules grid contains the columns described in the following table.

Knowledge Base Objects are the specific LogRhythm objects associated with a module. Any updated or new objects related to a module can be imported and synchronized at the next Knowledge Base import based on settings applied by an administrator.
The following objects can be contained within a module:
AI Engine Rules
Alarm Rules
FIM Policies
GLPRs
Investigations
Lists
Reports
Report Packages
Report Templates
Tails
A primary object is an object that is intentionally associated with a module.
A dependent object is an object that is part of a primary object, but is not a primary object for the module. This could be a list that is part of an Alarm Rule, or it could be a report template that is associated with a report.
From the Module Objects grid, you can view the list of objects for the selected module. The grid contains the fields described in the following table.

The following options are available on the Knowledge Base Manager toolbar.

The Knowledge Base file contains the modules and their associated objects.
When LogRhythm Labs sends out periodic updates or new content for the Knowledge Base, administrators can choose when or if a module should be updated. There is a step within the import process that permits changes to the modules prior to importing. For more information, see
Import a Knowledge Base
.

The Common Event Change Manager is a tool that enables you to make the appropriate updates based on user input for common events that have been modified. If custom objects reference a consolidated common event, that object may no longer function properly. Impacted custom objects include: Saved Investigations, Saved Tails, Personal Dashboard Filters, Reports, Alarm Rules, GLPRs, AI Engine Rules.

When you start to load a new Knowledge Base (KB), a migration inspection is performed to determine what objects contained within the user environment will be affected by importing the selected KB. If objects that will be affected are identified, the CE migration manager opens in a read-only mode and allows you to view the items that will be affected. At that point, you have the option to proceed with the Import a Knowledge Base (Version 7.3.x) or cancel.

The Common Event Change Manager runs automatically prior to a Knowledge Base import in which migration affected objects were detected during the pre-Knowledge Base Import Inspection. You are also prompted to open this tool each time the Deployment Manager is opened as long as affected objects remain in the database.
The Common Event Change Manager consists primarily of a grid which displays all analytic objects that are affected by migrated common events. The grid contains controls for the user to select migration options for the objects and commit the selected changes.

The preview appears prior to a Knowledge Base import. Normally, the Common Event Change Preview and the Common Event Change Manager display identical items. However, in some instances, the items in the Common Event Change Preview may be slightly different than the items shown in the Common Event Change Manager. Some items that are affected may not show up and some items that are not affected may show up. One case is when custom MPE rules use completely migrated common events.

Intelligent archiving is part of the Mediator/Message Processing Engine. It prevents logs, events, and LogMart data that do not conform to the TTL values set in Global Maintenance Settings from being added to the online databases. Instead, if your system is configured appropriately, this data is archived.
When Intelligent Archiving evaluates logs, it applies the following logic:
If an event is older than the TTL_Event value plus one day, it is not inserted into the LogRhythm_Events database. The log is archived if the system is configured to do so.
If a log is older than the TTL_LogMart value plus one week, it is not inserted into the LogRhythm_LogMart database. The log is archived if the system is configured to do so.
There are two TTL Global Data Management settings that work with Intelligent Archiving: TTL_LogMart and TTL_Event.
On the main toolbar, click
Deployment Manager
.
Click the
Platform Manager
tab.
Click
Global System Settings
.
You can modify any of the values evaluated and used by Intelligent Archiving:
TTL_LogMart

The LogRhythm Mediator Server service is responsible for archiving specified log data from active indexes to the LogRhythm Archives. The integrity of LogRhythm archives are protected during their various stages of processing through file attribute monitoring and SHA1 hashing. Archive file attributes, hashes or both are recorded by the LogRhythm system for use in verifying integrity during archive restoration and other operations. The Mediator Server uses configuration parameters that control the way the deployment archives data.
When you need access to archived logs, the SecondLook Wizard allows you to import them into a special archives index.

The contents of active and inactive archive files are the same: original log data and metadata generated during LogRhythm’s log processing. Active and inactive archive files are written to separate directories to ease backup of sealed archive files. The differences between the two are:
Active archive files have not reached the maximum size allowed and are still in the process of having data written to them. The maximum size is configurable.
Inactive archive files have been sealed.
Sealed archive files have been hashed for data integrity verification and compressed for storage.

LogRhythm archive files are binary files with a formatted file name. Uncompressed archives end with the file name extension .LUA and compressed archives end with the file name extension of .LCA.
A LogRhythm archive has the following naming scheme:
<NormalMsgDate>_<LogSourceId>_<HostID>_<MediatorID>_<CreationTicks>.<EXT>
LogRhythm archives are placed in the folders specified by the Mediator Server configuration.
Additionally, inactive archives are placed inside folders, grouped by day, for convenience. Inactive archive directories use this naming convention: YYYYMMDD_MediatorID_Ticks where ticks = milliseconds since 12:00:00 midnight, January 1, 0001.

Archive file protection refers to the method used to ensure the integrity of the contents of an archive file. During writes to the active archives, the archiver applies the appropriate level of file protection to ensure it is the only process that has written to, or altered, the file. Inactive file protection allows the archive file to be verified prior to restoration to ensure the integrity of the log data contained therein. Active and inactive archives have configurable levels of protection. The file protection levels are governed by the Mediator Server configuration.
The following protection levels are available:
None
. No protection used. Fastest, least computationally expensive option.
File Attribute Tracking
. The file size and last modification date are tracked by the archiver, to ensure it is the only process that has written to the file. Good performance, with lightweight data integrity verification.
SHA1 Hashing
. A SHA1 hash of the file is calculated. Most computationally expensive, but most reliable method for data integrity verification.
By default the archiver uses File Attribute Tracking on the active archive files, and SHA1 Hashing of the inactive archive files. This configuration offers the most balanced combination of computational efficiency, and file protection. The File Attributes or SHA1 Hash of each archive file is captured and stored in the Platform Manager database.
It is highly recommended that SHA1 Hashing protection not be used on the active archives, unless significant CPU and IO resources are available on the system running the Mediator service.

When an active archive is sealed, and becomes an inactive archive, the following steps are taken:
The final file protection parameters are gathered for the active archive (File Attributes or SHA1 Hash), if archive file protection is enabled.
The final file protection attributes are recorded in the LogRhythm Platform Manager database.
The archive is compressed, if compression is enabled.
The active archive is moved to the inactive directory and into that day's folder.

"Using the Rule Builder Common Event Browser, you can view the complete list of more than 40,000 common events. Use the predefined common events wherever possible. You can use the Common Event Manager to add, delete, and maintain the many different types of common events, and the classifications in which they reside. Common Events have a Risk Rating attribute that helps the Platform Manager determine how to handle an event properly. Common Events are specific to Rule Building, which uses rules developed to identify and extract, or parse specific, useful information from log messages. If you need to create a new common event, use the following guidelines:
Common events should be generically named so that they can be re-used for a wide variety of devices. For example, if a common event is being created for a log message that describes a successful connection to an FTP server, the common event should be named so that the FTP server type is irrelevant.
Good Name: FTP Connection Succeeded
Bad Name: Gene6 FTP Connection Succeeded
Good Name: FTP Connection Succeeded
Bad Name: Gene6 FTP Connection Succeeded
Common event names should always have the first letter of each word capitalized to make viewing common events in analysis tools more consistent.

"You use the Message Processing Engine (MPE) Rule Builder to view, create, and edit new MPE base rules and sub-rules. New rules are needed to collect and process logs from any new Log Source Type.

You can submit a Device Support Request to LogRhythm to have new rules developed by LogRhythm Engineers. Alternatively, you can build MPE Rules yourself; however, it is highly recommended that you attend the rule building training offered by LogRhythm before you attempt to build custom rules. Customers who attend LogRhythm Custom Rules Training have the option of taking the additional two-day Advanced Rule Development class. The class includes hands-on, instructor-led training and class materials that instruct you on how to create rules for your organization. This topic presents a brief overview of the MPE Rule Builder, but is not intended to be a substitute for the Advanced Rule Development training.
To find out more about available training schedules, contact your LogRhythm sales representative.

An MPE Policy is a collection of MPE Rules designed for a specific Log Source Type such as Cisco PIX or Windows 2003/2005 Security Event Log. Only Logs that are generated from Log Sources that have an assigned MPE Policy are processed by the MPE.
Log Sources can only be:
Assigned an MPE Policy associated with the same Log Source Type.
Assigned an individual MPE Policy.
The LogRhythm Knowledge Base comes with pre-packaged default MPE Policies for all supported devices. It is the MPE Policy, not the MPE Rule, that determines the data management and event management settings. The MPE Rule sets the default settings for the policy when the Rule is first added.
Custom Policies can be tailored to the type of system to which they are assigned. For example, event forwarding settings for security event logs on a file server could be different from those on a domain controller.
You can download MPE rules by going to the
LogRhythm Community
, clicking on the
Shareables
link on menu at the top of the page, and then click on the
Log Sources
option. The filters allow you to choose from supported and unsupported plugins, as well as ones created by LogRhythm or by other users.

The rules used for identifying and processing log messages include:
Base Rule
. Contains a tagged regular expression (the regex) used to identify the pattern of a log and isolate interesting pieces of metadata. Using a tagging system, these metadata strings can be directed to special fields used by LogRhythm to better interpret a log or specifically identify it. In general, base rules identify log messages by matching the fields to a specific log format or pattern.
Sub-rule
. Differentiates log messages that match the same base rule using values in the log. Sub-rule tags can include a regex that only applies to the string in a specific field to identify information such as a log / event identification number, a message string, or even a user or group name.
LogRhythm MPE rules use .NET/C# syntax for writing regular expressions.

Here is an example of a log message that might be received via syslog depicting a Microsoft SQL Server authentication.
6/18/2007 2:36 PM TYPE=Information USER=NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM COMP=DBSERVER SORC=MSSQLSERVER CATG=Logon EVID=17055 MESG=18453 : Login succeeded for
user ''NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM''. Connection: Trusted.
The base rule matching this log is named SQL Server Authentication, and has the following regex:
COMP=(?<dname>[^\s]+)?\s+SORC=mssqlserver\sCATG=.+?EVID=17055\s+MESG=(?<tag1>
18453|18454|18455|18456).+?user\s\'([^\\]+?\\)?(?<tag2.login>[^\']+)\'.*+?\\)
?(?<tag2.login>[^\']+)\'.*
This base rule matches the pattern of the log and pull the metadata textDBSERVER into the <dname> tag, 18453 into <tag1>, and NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM into <tag2.login> (which puts the metadata into both the <tag2> and <login> fields).
The sub-rule matching the metadata in those tags is then MS-AppLog Msg 18453: Successful Authentication, which matches when 18453 is in <tag1>, and anything (*) is in the <tag2> field. This sub-rule specifically identifies the occurrence as a successful authentication to a SQL server.

Rules are evaluated in the following order:
Custom base rules are always run before system base rules
Custom sub-rules are always run before system sub-rules
Sub-rules where VMID should equal a specific value are always processed before sub-rules where VMID can be any value including system sub-rules
Processing logic for a log:
Evaluate log against base rule, if matched.
Evaluate log against all sub-rules:
If sub-rule is matched, associate log with sub-rule.
If no sub-rules or no sub-rule match, associate log with base rule unless base rule is a pattern.
Pattern rules:
Use in instances where a log should only match a sub-rule.
To specify a base rule as a pattern, prefix the rule name with “Pattern”.
Pattern rules are processed differently in the Test Center. To test such rules, rename them without using the prefix ""Pattern."" Add the ""Pattern"" prefix back when you have finished testing.
To specify a base rule as a pattern, prefix the rule name with “Pattern”.
Pattern rules are processed differently in the Test Center. To test such rules, rename them without using the prefix ""Pattern."" Add the ""Pattern"" prefix back when you have finished testing.

MPE Base rules are auto-sorted and have the following options
Customers can specify static or auto-sorting for each custom base rule.
Customers can enforce relative ordering for each auto-sorted custom base rule.
Customers can override the relative ordering for each auto-sorted system base rule.
Customers can specify that an auto-sorted custom rule should sort above all system rules.
System sub-rules and custom sub-rules are statically sorted.
The rule processing order for Base Rules is:
Custom Base rules by Sort Order
Custom Sub-rules where the value parsed for VMID should be a specific value (i.e., VMID=1001, VMID=1002…) by sort order.
All other Custom Sub-rules by sort order.
System Base rules by Sort Order:
Custom Sub-rules where the value parsed for VMID should be a specific value (i.e., VMID=1001, VMID=1002…) by sort order.
System Sub-rules where the value parsed for VMID should be a specific value (i.e., VMID=1001, VMID=1002…) by sort order.
All other Custom Sub-rules by sort order.
All other System Sub-rules by sort order

When using wildcards and Regexes, it is important to understand how their sorting is treated by the MPE. The sort order determines the priority in which a sub-rule is matched. For instance, if you have a sub-rule where all the mapping tags are wildcards, you want to make sure this sub-rule is the last sorted item, because sorting it higher would cause it to always match, and rules below would never be tested for matching. Sorting only affects sub-rules with wildcards and Regexes. Sorting is irrelevant for sub-rules where each mapping tag value is specified since the sub-rule only matches the exact values specified.
The MPE processes rules in the following order:
Custom sub-rules where VMID is equal to a specific value.
System sub-rules where VMID is equal to a specific value.
Custom sub-rules where VMID is NOT equal to a specific value.
System sub-rules where VMID is NOT equal to a specific value.

There are three statuses used in the MPE Rule Builder, which can determine how created MPE rules are applied to log messages.
This allows the rule to be applied to log messages by the MPE in the LogRhythm SIEM.
Previously, the Test status would not trigger alarms and would automatically disable rules after 1000 log messages were processed. However, the Test status is currently functionally identical to the Production status. MPE rules that are new and undergoing testing can be given the Test status, and once the rules have passed testing and are ready for everyday use, they can be given the Production status.
The logs that match the MPE Rule can be displayed on the Dashboard.
Custom MPE rules can be edited, even in Production mode; however, System MPE Rules (created by LogRhythm) cannot be edited.
Review the scmedsvr.log file for messages about performance issues.

The following tables provide lists of all the metadata fields LogRhythm can parse, as well as their associated parsing tags, and default regex. The fields are grouped by how they appear in the Web Console. If you do not see a field in the Web Console in the same tab as this document, you may have tagged the field as a favorite, in which case the field will appear in the Favorites tab instead of the main group tab as shown in this document. If necessary, the default regex can be overridden, as described in Override the Default Regex.

Five additional tags are available for identifying data in the log specifically for sub-rules. These tags do not parse text into metadata fields, so they do not appear in Investigations, Reports, and so on. These tags are intended only to identify portions of the log message that should be used in the development of sub-rules.

The default regex is applied by using only the named group tag. For example, <account> will apply the regex pattern \w+ in the rule, as shown in the table above.
If the default regex for a parsing tag will not properly parse the correct data out of the log message or is not the optimal regex from a performance perspective, the default should be overridden. To override the default regex, the following syntax should be used:
For example, suppose your regex needs to match file names with a specific extension such as the sample log message below:
If the base rule was written as:
The value parsed for login would be john and the value for object would be AnnualReport. This is due to the fact that a period is not a word character and the default regex of “\w+” would only match up to the period. Instead, the default regular expressions should be overridden, and the base rule should be:
Now, the base rule will parse anything for login starting with a word character that optionally contains a period followed by additional word characters.
Do not override the default regex for fields which parse an IP address, such as <sip>, <dip>, <sipv6>, and so on.

"The purpose of the Common Event Change Manager is to assist in the migration of the Common Events in your affected objects. There are two types of objects you need to migrate if they contain changed Common Events:
System Objects with Custom filters: Primary, Include, and/or Exclude filters
Custom objects
LogRhythm recommends that you choose the Common Event to MPE Rule migration option for System Objects to retain the behavior of the initial object.
If you migrate Common Event to Common Event, multiple Common Events may result where there was previously only one.
If you migrate Common Event to MPE Rule, a large list of MPE Rules may result. This list may be harder to maintain in the future, but may also more accurately reflect the old filter behavior.

Up to 2 million items can be imported. However, only 30,000 items can be edited in the interface.
Items in a list that are going to be imported must be separated with a comma (,) or line breaks. Leading/trailing spaces are removed.
No validation is done on the contents of a file or the clipboard. They are both treated as if they were text. The items are imported as if the user had added them manually using repeated Add Item operations. The Items list is left in an uncommitted state, so you can preview the result and choose either

or
Cancel
.
Can be ANSI or UTF. If the file has a UTF byte mark header, it is interpreted as UTF. Otherwise, it is interpreted as Extended ASCII.
Only extended ASCII (not Unicode) characters are officially supported in LogRhythm.
Simple textual file of line-break-separated list items. All three line-break formats are supported (CR, LF, CRLF).
Final item does not need to be terminated.
Empty items are ignored (that is, two or more successive line breaks.)
Empty files are legal (removes all items.)

"Monitoring, searching, and analyzing are done through a number of features in the Client Console. These include:
Alarm Viewer
Investigator
Personal Dashboard
Quick Search Toolbar
Tail
TopX Analysis
In addition, the following tools assist with further using these monitoring, searching, and analyzing features.

Monitoring and searching the system for logs is done with the Tool Selector. It provides a user-friendly method to manage the many views of Personal Dashboard and Investigator. In the system layout, it is docked at the left of the window. The Tool Selector is specific to the Tool in which it resides.
To unpin the Tool Selector, click the pin icon in the upper-right corner of the Tool Selector so that the point faces left. This collapses the Tool Selector so that it is a tab along the left that you can then open to see the groups and views.
To pin the Tool Selector, click the pin icon in the upper-right corner of the Tool Selector so that it appears to be pointing down into the screen. This keeps the Tool Selector visible while working within the tool.
The Tool Selector has four groups of views. Each group is encapsulated in a box that can be collapsed or expanded by clicking the arrow at the right of the header. Views that are open and displayed within the window are listed in bold within the group. Views that are not open and displayed within the window will be listed in regular text (not bold).
To bring a view into the window, select it within the group box. It changes to bold and is brought forth as the active displayed view within the window.
To remove a view from the window, select it within the group box. It changes from bold to regular text and is removed from the tabs of available views within the window.

LogRhythm provides several tools to search and retrieve log data. After your search results appear, right-click to access additional options in the following locations:

"The powerful LogRhythm Investigator search tool allows you to view logs and events collected in near-real-time from both the Data Processor and Platform Manager Databases. Investigator default settings are configured in
My Preferences
.

After you run an investigation, LogRhythm offers a rich set of grids, graphs, and charts to view the collected data. The initial search results window that appears depends on the type of search that was run. Results from Platform Manager and Data Processor searches appear in a window with two primary tabs, Log/Event Analyzer and Log Viewer, with additional views available from the Properties window under the File menu on the toolbar. Results from a Log Miner search appear in several different panes. A screen tip displays a definition of any column heading when you point to it.

The Log/Event Analyzer tab allows you to view aggregate statistics from the following tabs and sub-tabs, which are located at the bottom of the window. On the Tool Selector, the active view(s) are in boldface type. In Platform Manager and Data Processor searches, the Tool Selector appears on the left side of the screen.
Aggregate Log/Event List
Logs/Events by Time by Type
Logs/Events by Time by Direction
Logs by Day and Hour
Logs by Day of Week and Hour
User (Origin) Statistics
Provides log statistics for each recorded User Origin.
All statistics tabs include the following subtabs: Logs by Time, KBytes by Time, Packets by Time, User (Origin) by Logs, Host (Impacted) by KBytes (iHost Total), Host (Impacted) by Packets (iHost Total).
Host (Origin) Statistics
Host (Impacted) Statistics
Application Statistics
Vendor Message ID Statistics
This diagram shows the relationship between Hosts in the current set of aggregated logs/events.
The right side of the window displays a diagram based on the Investigation results. Only logs that have a source or destination host appear. The left side of the window lists statistics for items selected in the diagram and provides options and controls to modify the view. The diagram features include the following:
A high-level aggregate view that you can expand by clicking the + signs
A hierarchical display that includes the following:
Root
. The diagram hub. Its statistics show the logs processed and logs skipped.
Entity
. Global, Primary, and custom Entities including child Entities.
Zone
. Internal; DMZ; External; Unknown
Location
. Country, Region, City.
Location is only available when GeoIPLevel is enabled in the
Data Processor Advanced Properties
.
Network
. The order is:
Known Network
. Logs where Host.NetworkID is in the Network.
IP Range Network
. Logs where Host.IP has a value.
Named Host
. All other Hosts.
Host Group
. If any Hosts remain in a higher-level group after all other grouping, they are placed in a generic Host Group sorted by IP and then Name.

A red outline around nodes that contain logs with a log failure count> 0.
A width of the links between parent and child nodes that is proportional to the Link Display Mode value of the parent. The larger the number, the wider the line. This allows you to locate the greatest areas of activity at a glance.
For example, in the following diagram where Link Display Mode is set to Logs:
Primary Site, Total Log Count = 48,000 logs:
Internal node, widest line, Total Log Count = 42,000 logs.
Named Hosts, widest line, Total Log Count = 35,000
0.0.0.0:255.255.255.255, medium line, Total Log Count = 6,000
Wallis and Futuna (green field hidden at the bottom), narrowest line, Total Log Count = 1,000


The Log Viewer tab allows you to view individual logs and events and perform other operations on selected logs.

Log Miner is a summary overview and trending tool that is opened after you perform a LogMart Search with Investigator. Log Miner's flexible graphing capabilities make it extremely helpful in understanding your environment's activity for time periods far longer than the time to live (TTL) setting.
Log Miner has five view panes that display data in different ways.
Log Message Occurrences by Day and Hour of Day
. This graph displays each day's logs as a solid shape of a unique color. By viewing the log data by day, in a stack, it is easy to see peak times for log data by looking for the tallest peak stacks in the graph. This pane has the following functionality:
Hovering over a day selects that shape.
Hovering over different areas of one day's colored shape displays log counts by hour in the screen tip.
Double-clicking one day's colored shape causes Log Miner to drill down to that day.
Hovering over a day selects that shape.
Hovering over different areas of one day's colored shape displays log counts by hour in the screen tip.
Double-clicking one day's colored shape causes Log Miner to drill down to that day.
Log Message Occurrences by Day of Week and Hour of Day
. This graph displays each day's logs in a unique color and row, and each hour's logs as a distinct data pillar. By viewing log data by days broken into hours, it is easy to recognize peak days of activity by the row with the highest values, or a peak hour of activity by the tallest pillar. This pane has the following functionality:
Hovering over a day's colored row highlights that day's row and fade out other days for easier viewing.
Hovering over different hours of one day's colored row displays log counts by hour in the screen tip.
Double-clicking one hour's pillar causes Log Miner to drill down to that hour.
Hovering over a day's colored row highlights that day's row and fade out other days for easier viewing.
Hovering over different hours of one day's colored row displays log counts by hour in the screen tip.
Double-clicking one hour's pillar causes Log Miner to drill down to that hour.
Aggregate Log Messages
. This pane gives a detailed view of the aggregate log data being used to generate the graphs. Information on date / time, counts, Common Event, direction, and more are all included.
Log Message Occurrences by Hour
. This graph provides a linear timeline view of the log activity, with each bar representing a particular hour.
Day of Week and Hour of Day Filter
. This pane allows filtering, by days or hours, to be completed very quickly. Select or clear the check boxes in this pane to change filtering.

The maximum amount of space (in GB) to be used by the PM Insert Manager Disk Queue. A value of 0 indicates no maximum.
A warning event is written when 80% of the specified space is used. If the maximum is reached, the oldest spool files are deleted until the space used by the spool files is less than the specified maximum.
This value determines the maximum number of Platform Manager logs that will be inserted per second. The insertion rate will not exceed this value. Note that this value is based on the performance profile of the system.
The minimum of amount of space (in GB) that must be available on the volume that the PM Insert Disk Queue spool files are being written to.
If the minimum is reached, the oldest spool files are deleted until the space used by the spool files is above the specified minimum.
Specify the size for each log distribution receiver queue. Every receiver has its own queue. If this queue reaches maximum size, logs will be dropped. However setting queue size too high could result in excessive memory utilization.
Specify the size of primary log distribution queue. If this queue reaches maximum size, logs will be dropped. However setting queue size too high could result in excessive memory utilization.
Enforce Agent Certificate Revocation Check. If this fails, the Mediator will disconnect from the Agent and logs will be written to the scmedsvr.log.
Enforce Agent certificate Trusted Authority Check. If this fails, the Mediator will disconnect from the Agent and logs will be written to the scmedsvr.log.
Specifies the level of compression to apply to data and indices.
This is obsolete in the current version and changing its value has no impact on indexing and compression.
Setting this property to false reduces data transmission volume at the cost of normalizing enumerable values. Metadata fields such as Log Source Type and Common Event will be presented as ID numbers instead of readable text. Disabling this feature decreases the usability of downstream features such as Log Distribution Service and full text search.
IP to Name DNS resolution mode.
Values: Off, Resolve All, Resolve Internal
Resolve IP addresses to their associated DNS names.
DNSResolveMsgSourceHostIP
The level of detail to resolve for Geographic IP lookup.
Options = None, Country, Region, and City. If this is left set to None, GeoIP location will not be resolved for logs or Network Visualization.
Sets the MPE logging level (log written to scmpe.log).
Options: Off, Error, Warning, Info, Verbose, Debug

"The Data Processor has three primary interface points with the LogRhythm SIEM:
The Data Processor (Mediator) sends logs to the Data Indexer.
The Data Indexer reads information from the EMDB.
The Client Console and Web Console issue queries about logs to the Data Indexer.
The Data Processor's Mediator Server service handles communications with LogRhythm Agents, such as authenticating Agent connections, receiving log data, and informing
System Monitors
to shut down or failover when required. The Mediator is also responsible for processing logs against the Knowledge Base and sending processed log messages to the
Data Indexer
.
The Data Processor contains a log processing engine known as the Message Processing Engine (MPE). The MPE processes logs against rules (MPE rules) to identify logs, parse information from the logs, and forward certain logs as events to the Platform Manager.
In medium-to-large deployments, Data Processors should be dedicated systems. In small deployments, the Data Processor can coexist on the same system as the
Platform Manager
.

LogRhythm provides support for Agent failover across several Data Processors (up to three is the most common configuration). Three prioritized Processors configured into the Agent as mediator1, mediator2, and mediator3 (ordered list). Collection performance is maintained across Mediator failover, and this capability can also be used to support Agent load balancing.
One of three scenarios can cause an Agent to failover to a different Processor:
The Processor currently serving the Agent is already servicing its maximum agent count.
The Processor is unavailable due to inability to establish connection or a lost connection (for example, a network issue).
The Processor issues a suspense condition.
The Failback Delay can be configured in the System Monitor Agent Advanced Properties dialog box.

All Agents support a configurable timer for failback and can be configured on a per Agent basis.
Upon expiration, the Agent waits for a randomized delay period (1-30 seconds) prior to attempting to connect.

Load balanced virtual log sources let you specify the log sources that are being sent to a load balancer and the System Monitor Agents to which the load balancer is sending log messages. These options enable deployments with larger volumes to utilize load balanced log sources without data loss. Even though Agents don’t send data to more than one Data Processor at a time, the Agents used with load balanced log sources must be configured to communicate with all Mediators that are used for load balancing for that set of agents.
For more information on how to configure the Agents correctly, see the Data Processor Settings Tab information in
Modify System Monitor Basic Properties
.

All Agents support a configurable timer for load balancing and can be configured on a per Agent basis. When an Agent has connected to a Processor after being in a failure condition due to the Processor reaching the maximum Agent connections, the Agent attempts load balancing after a configurable time period.
Upon expiration of this timer, the Agent waits for a randomized delay period (1-30 minutes) prior to attempting to reconnect. This is to prevent a surge of Agents reconnecting.
After waiting for the randomized delay period, the Agent attempts to connect to the primary Data Processor. If it does not succeed because of maximum Agent connections, it attempts the secondary and then the tertiary.

The Mediator Server writes the following log files to the logs directory in the Mediator Server installation directory:

The Mediator Server maintains files for keeping track of processed and unprocessed logs, events when the server shuts down with logs, and events in memory. These files are stored in a directory structure in the state sub-directory of the Mediator Server. When the server is restarted, the logs and events are read in from the files and processed. To ensure the reliable processing of collected log data, do not move, alter or manipulate the files in the state directory in any way.

The Data Processors actively monitor themselves and Agents for a heartbeat signal at regular intervals. After receiving the signal, the database is updated with a timestamp of the last successful signal from that component. The ARM service regularly checks the amount of time that passed since the last successful heartbeat from each component and compares it with the component's unique Heartbeat Warning Interval setting, set in the Properties dialog box. If the expected reporting time is greater than the Heartbeat Warning Interval, a Missing Heartbeat Warning event is generated. The warnings continue to be generated each time an additional Heartbeat Warning Interval passes without a signal.
After a heartbeat is received from the component, a Heartbeat Returned event is generated and the system again waits for a missing heartbeat condition.
Set a reasonable Heartbeat Warning Interval. Take special notice of systems that reside on non-persistent connections or are removable from the network, such as notebook computers.
You can see the Heartbeat status in the grid on the top of the Data Processors tab and in the grid on the bottom of the System Monitors tab.
If a Heartbeat is not received for one full Heartbeat Warning Interval, the Last Heartbeat field is yellow.
If a Heartbeat is not received for two full Heartbeat Warning Intervals, the Last Heartbeat field is red.

The Last Data Processor column in the grid on the bottom of the System Monitors tab contains the name of the last Data Processor the Agent was connected to.

"The System Monitor is a software component that provides local and remote log data collection across various English-based operating systems including Windows and *NIX. For a complete list of supported operating systems, see the
LogRhythm System Monitor Compatibility and Functionality
guide.
The agent serves as a central log data collector, collecting logs from many devices, servers, databases, and applications, performing host activity monitoring and forwarding logs, via authenticated TLC connections, to the Data Processor.
This section describes working with System Monitors in the Client Console. The System Monitor component releases on a separate schedule from the SIEM. For information on System Monitor releases and installation, see the separate
System Monitor
documentation.

Standard and Realtime FIM are included with the System Monitor Lite license for desktop operating systems only. Server operating systems require System Monitor Pro or Collector. For a list of supported agents, see the
Realtime File Integrity Monitor (FIM) Support by Operating System
table.

To view a table that lists Agent Functionality of the 32-bit and 64-bit System Monitor Agents, see the
System Monitor Functionality by Operating System
.

You must license each System Monitor to connect to a Data Processor and forward data.
LogRhythm provides the following three types of Agent licenses:
System Monitor Lite
System Monitor Pro
System Monitor Collector
When a LogRhythm Agent is registered in the Deployment Manager, it is automatically assigned a System Monitor Pro license, if one is available; otherwise it is assigned a System Monitor Lite license.
To view a table that lists Agent functionality by license, see
System Monitor Functionality by License: Lite, Pro, and Collector
.

With the exception of flat file collection and Windows Event Logs (see Unicode (Double-Byte) Character Support below), LogRhythm only supports ASCII and extended ASCII characters within collected log data.
LogRhythm extended ASCII support is only available for code page 1252 encoding for the following languages:
Afrikaans
Basque
Catalan
Danish
Dutch
English
Faroese
Finnish
French
Galician
German
Icelandic
Indonesian
Italian
Malay
Norwegian
Portuguese
Spanish
Swahili
Swedish

LogRhythm supports Unicode characters when collected from Windows Event Logs and flat file Log Sources on Windows and *NIX. Search for Unicode characters is supported only in raw log and metadata searches against the Data Indexer. Currently, Unicode characters are not supported in:
Events (PM search)
Alarms
Lists
Web Console search
If you have log message sources that are not flat file sources, and these sources contain Unicode or double-byte characters, you can do the following (listed in order of preference to create the least impact when working with such sources):
Reconfigure the logging device to create ASCII log messages only.
Rewrite processing rules so that they only identify text up to the first non-ASCII character.
Disable the specific rules that process non-ASCII characters.
Disable all processing for the log source.

Running the System Monitor initially with a LogLevel of Verbose is useful to allow you to troubleshoot and tune the System Monitor configuration parameters. The two most important parameters to tune are:
CycleTime
. The minimum time the Agent spends in a processing cycle. If the processing cycle takes longer than the CycleTime, the Agent immediately begins the next cycle. If the processing cycle is shorter than the CycleTime, the agent sleeps for the remainder of the CycleTime. This property is set in the Agent Advanced Properties window. For more information, see
Modify System Monitor Advanced Properties
. Default: 10 seconds.
MaxMessageCount
. Should be set to a value that keeps up reasonably with the log sources being monitored. Forwarding log data in small batches with smaller a CycleTime is generally better than sending large batches over a long CycleTime. This prevents extended periods of concentrated network traffic and is easier for the Data Processor to process. This property is set in the Message Source Properties window. For more information, see
Log Sources
. Default: 100.
To extract the log data in a timely manner, these parameters must be set to keep up with the source in question. It is useful to observe if the System Monitor reads its full MaxMessageCount in each cycle. This can be found in the System Monitor Agent log - scsm.log (Agent LogLevel must be set to Verbose). When the System Monitor is started on a new source, it spends some time catching up to the most recent log. After it reaches the end, if it is still reading MaxMessageCount log entries each cycle, then this parameter should probably be increased to keep up with the log.

If a given source is not critical for real-time monitoring, then consider scheduling it to run at a time when the log is not very busy using the MonitorStart and MonitorStop parameters in the Log Source Advanced Properties window.

The Agent can follow log rotations while collecting from files, but cannot finish reading a log file that is compressed. The results of reading a compressed file are unpredictable. Disable compression of the log sources that the Agent is monitoring. Most Linux systems use the logrotate utility and its corresponding config file logrotate.conf to control this compression. See the logrotate documentation for details.

The System Monitor produces a state tracking file (*.pos files) for each source in its configuration that it is monitoring. These files maintain position information across program shutdowns and subsequent startup. It is important not to remove or delete these files unless you really want the System Monitor to begin at the start of the log file again. The position tracking files are located in the state directory of the Agent.

The System Monitor spools in memory log data to a file if necessary, such as when a local shutdown is requested after having lost connection to a Data Processor. The log data in suspense.log is read by the System Monitor on startup for immediate forwarding to the Data Processor. The suspense.log file is hidden and deleted after being loaded at startup.
The Windows Agent also spools syslog data to a local file if its memory cap is exceeded. The syslog data written to file is then read and sent to a Data Processor when the Agent memory usage falls below its memory cap. The syslog suspense file is located in the state directory of the Agent. TCP suspense folder and UDP suspense folder are combined together as one single suspense folder (syslogsuspense) due to the underlying reason that TCP/UDP is a protocol/communication type and not a log source type.

The Agent initiates all connections to the Data Processor. In order for the Agent to communicate across a firewall, a two-way TCP pinhole, or exception rule, must be opened from the Agent's host IP and Client TCP Port to the Data Processor's host IP and ServerSSLPort, and back. Client TCP Port is specified on the Data Processor Settings tab in the System Monitor Agent properties, and ServerSSLPort is specified in the Advanced Data Processor Properties window. For more information, see
Modify Data Processor Advanced Properties
. Agents prior to v4.0.0 connect to the Data Processor without using SSL, and instead connect to the port controlled by the ServerPort setting specified in the advanced properties of the Data Processor record.

The LogRhythm Windows Agent can be configured to listen on the standard syslog UDP/TCP port of 514 for incoming syslog data. When a syslog message is received, the following process occurs:
The time the syslog message was received by the syslog server is captured. The time is relative to the Agent receiving the syslog and is reflected by the Normal Message Date of the log. This Normal Message Date may also be corrected by the Data Processor to account for time offsets between the Agent and the Data Processor.
The IP endpoint and the IP address contained in the syslog packet are captured by the Agent.
If the IP address captured from the syslog packet is present in the Agent's Syslog Relay Hosts parameter, the Agent runs the syslog message through the list of regex strings contained in the Agent's Syslog Relay Regular Expressions parameter to parse out an IP address or host name identifier.
The regex match is done against the pre-processed log with the syslog header, not against the raw log after it reaches the Data Processor.
If the IP address captured from the syslog packet is not present in the Agent's Syslog Relay Hosts, then the Agent uses the IP address contained in the syslog packet as an IP address identifier.
If the IP address captured from the syslog packet is present in the Agent's Syslog Relay Hosts parameter, the Agent runs the syslog message through the list of regex strings contained in the Agent's Syslog Relay Regular Expressions parameter to parse out an IP address or host name identifier.
The regex match is done against the pre-processed log with the syslog header, not against the raw log after it reaches the Data Processor.
If the IP address captured from the syslog packet is present in the Agent's Syslog Relay Hosts parameter, the Agent runs the syslog message through the list of regex strings contained in the Agent's Syslog Relay Regular Expressions parameter to parse out an IP address or host name identifier.
The regex match is done against the pre-processed log with the syslog header, not against the raw log after it reaches the Data Processor.
If the IP address captured from the syslog packet is not present in the Agent's Syslog Relay Hosts, then the Agent uses the IP address contained in the syslog packet as an IP address identifier.
If present, the syslog priority is parsed from the syslog data and converted into a syslog facility and severity that is appended to the syslog message. If no syslog priority is present, the facility is set to local0 and the severity is set to information.
The Agent then performs a lookup into its syslog virtual message sources to see if the identifier has a virtual message source assigned and assigns the proper message source parameters (source id, TTL, and archive mode). If the Agent does not find a virtual message source, it submits a virtual source lookup request to the Mediator Server.
The Agent then either adds the syslog data to the message queue for delivery to a Data Processor or may spool it to the syslogsuspense directory if it cannot be delivered to a Data Processor (connection issue, unauthenticated syslog source, etc.). If the data is spooled to disk, then the agent periodically reloads this data after it is connected to a Data Processor.

Following is an example of the syslog data received by the LogRhythm Windows Agent and the final syslog format format stored in the Data Indexer:
Syslog data received:
The following syslog message was received from host 192.168.1.10 on Dec 12 11:00:01 AM 2006.
<13>Dec 12 11:00:00 This is a syslog message
Priority = 13
Date = Dec 12 11:00:00
Message = This is a syslog message
The following syslog message was received from host 192.168.1.10 on Dec 12 11:00:01 AM 2006.
Syslog message stored in Data Processor:
The syslog message would appear as follows in the Data Indexer:

"You can modify basic System Monitor properties using the tabs in the System Monitor Agent Properties window.
On the main toolbar, click
Deployment Manager
.
Click the
System Monitors
tab.
Right-click the System Monitor you want to configure, and then click
Properties
.
Configure the values according to the information in the following table, and then click
OK.
If you have the correct permissions but are unable to modify an Agent's settings, it likely has a configuration policy applied. Look at the Agent Settings tab of the properties dialogue box to see if there is a policy listed under Configuration Policy. For more information, see
System Monitor Configuration Policy Manager
.

Host Agent is Installed on
The default Host record log messages collected by the System Monitor should be assigned to. This value can be overridden at the Message Source level.
System Monitor Agent Name
Enter a unique name for the System Monitor. The name cannot be same as an existing or previously deleted System Monitor.
Host OS Type
Specify whether the agent is installed on a Windows, Linux, Solaris, AIX, or HP-UX host.
Specify a value between 1 minute and 30 days. This is the amount of time that a heartbeat signal from this Agent can be late by, before a Missing Heartbeat Warning event is generated. Warnings continue to be generated at this interval until a heartbeat is successfully received. The default value is one minute, or 60 seconds.

Select and configure Data Processors the agent should forward logs to. Determine order in which Data Processors are used by increasing or decreasing the priority. The first checked Data Processor in the list has the highest priority. An Agent can only connect to one Data Processor at a time, but tries other Data Processors if the primary is unavailable. Reorder the entries to set the priority.
For Agents that collect load balanced log sources, select all available Data Processors that are used for load balancing for that set of Agents. For example, Agents 1, 2, and 3 are load balanced and sending logs to Data Processors A, B and C. Agents 4, 5, and 6 are load balanced and sending logs to Data Processors X, Y, and Z. When configuring the System Monitor Agent Properties for Agent 2, you will see all available Data Processors in the Data Processors to Use section. You would select Data Processors A, B, and C to prevent errors in data processing. For more information, see
Load Balancing
.
You can set them to any priority order, but if all load balanced Agents don’t include the same Data Processors in their configuration, the Data Processors receiving load balanced log sources data from load balanced Agents will fail to process the data.
The following warning in scmedsvr.log indicates your load balanced log source agents might be configured incorrectly. **WARNING** Invalid message source ID received from Agent
<agent name>
(LogSourceId=
<ID number>
) - no such ID exists in the LogRhythm deployment.
Specify the interface that the System Monitor uses for communications to this Data Processor. Valid values for the Agent IP/Address Index are
0
-
99
, or an IP address. Numeric values determine which network interface card to use. A value of
0
is the first available network interface card. An Agent IP address value is the static IP address of the NIC to listen on. Only use an IP address when the IP never changes (no DHCP).
The local agent port the System Monitor uses to communicate with this Data Processor. The valid range is 0 to to 65535.

When processing a syslog, the Agent attempts to parse out the time stamp embedded in the syslog message and uses that value as the collection time (normal message date) for the log rather than the time the Agent received the syslog. If no timestamp can be parsed from the syslog message, the collection time (the time the log was received on the Agent’s syslog interface) is used as the normal message date.
Entries indicate that the IP address the Agent is receiving the log from, specified in the list. This is not the real source of the message. It is a relaying device. When the Agent sees an IP listed here, it uses special parsing, specified in the Syslog Relay Regular Expressions field, to determine the true source of the traffic. The list should contain a single IP address per line.
Syslog Relay Regular
Expressions
Contains Regex strings that serve to identify and parse information from syslog data. Note the following:
If a syslog sending device's IP address is contained in the Syslog Relay Hosts field, then these Regex strings are used to find and parse out the host identifier information. The host identifier information can be either an IP address or a host name. If none of the Regex strings in this field successfully parse out a
hostidentifier
then the IP address of the sending device is used as the host identifier.
This field should contain a single Regex string per line.
The regex is case sensitive.
The regex match is done against the pre-processed log with the syslog header, not against the raw log after it reaches the Data Processor.
The following Regex tags are valid within the syslog Regex strings:
priority
message
year
month
day
hour
minute
seconds
hostidentifier
priority
message
year
month
day
hour
minute
seconds
hostidentifier
Open the drop-list and select the load balanced group with which to associate the Agent.
For more information on creating load balanced groups, see
Load Balanced Agent Groups
.



Enable Standard or Realtime FIM.
If Realtime Mode Anomaly Detection is enabled, the Realtime FIM engine recomputes the hash for each file once every 24 hours. If the hash value has changed since it was last computed, FIM generates a ""missed"" modify event (MissedModifyAnomalyEvent).
When File Integrity Monitor is enabled, you must select at least one policy from the list. The field is only enabled when Enable File Integrity Monitor is selected.

"System Monitor Lite, Pro, and Collector Agents collect and forward log data to Data Processors. Additionally, System Monitor Pro or Collector Agents can also perform File Integrity Monitor (FIM) operations. When FIM detects changes in files and directories, the Agent generates a log and sends it to the Data Processor. For more information, see
Networking and Communication
.
The Windows version of the Agent can also collect Event Logs remotely from other Windows hosts. It has an RFC 3164 compliant syslog server built in that can be used to collect syslog data transmitted over a network.

One System Monitor Pro or Collector license is provided and assigned to the System Monitor that runs on each LogRhythm appliance. When you add a new System Monitor, it will be assigned a System Monitor Pro license if available. If a System Monitor Pro license is not available, a System Monitor Lite license is assigned.
To view the agent functionality matrix, see
LogRhythm Compatibility and System Monitor Functionality Guide
.
To view System Monitor Lite and System Monitor Pro or Collector features, see
System Monitor Functionality by License: Lite vs. Pro/Collector
.

In some cases, a System Monitor will need to be created with least privilege user rights. This enables the System Monitor to exist in an environment outside the DMZ. In this case, the System Monitor needs limited access to other components such as the Performance Monitor. To configure the System Monitor with least privilege user rights, see
Least Privileged User

"
There are general guidelines, considerations, and standards to consider prior to deploying your solution within a network. This page covers the networking and communication considerations and requirements to help you deploy your solution.
LogRhythm Server IP Addresses
. LogRhythm appliances include multiple network interfaces to accommodate different deployment topologies. All IP addresses should be statically assigned or reserved to avoid IP changes. For many topologies, best practice is to use the dedicated out-of-band management 1Gb interfaces (iDRAC) and one of the 10Gb interfaces for data. Each LogRhythm Server should only have 1 IP address presented to the Operating System.
DNS Resolution
. It is recommended that the LogRhythm server acting as the Platform Manager be entered into DNS so it is addressable by name.
Domain Membership
. A LogRhythm server does not need to be a member of the Windows Domain to function correctly. However, LogRhythm recommends adding it to make remote event log collection easier to manage.
Remote Event Log Collection User Account
. A special user account must be created on the domain for remote event log collection. For more information, see
Windows Event Log Collection
.
Network Address Translation
. Network address translation (NAT) cannot be used between core components (AIE, DP, DX, PM, Web). All communications between these components must be real IP to real IP.
MTU.
LogRhythm backend components should all use matching MTU configuration and path-MTU-discovery (ICMP-Type3, Code4) must be allowed between all LogRhythm Components, Agents, and externally dependent services (NAS for archives, backups, etc). Fragmentation issues traversing network paths can cause significant reductions in performance.
LogRhythm components communicate over TCP, UDP, or HTTPS on specific ports. TLS is used when receiving logs at the Data Processor from the LogRhythm System Monitor and also when sending logs from the Data Processor to AI Engine. The diagram below shows the communication between the components and the specific protocols and ports used.


The following tables list all network communications and interactions within a LogRhythm deployment. They can assist system and network administrators with configuration of network access control devices and software.


Client: AI Engine
Cluster membership and inter-node communications between Consul instances
Port 8301 must be opened for TCP and UDP traffic on all hosts (PM, DP, DX, AIE, Web) in your deployment, with the exception of Client Console and Agent hosts. 8301 is the bi-directional communication port used between all Consul hosts. If the port is blocked, hosts in your deployment will not be able to join the Consul cluster. No log data or customer data is passed between hosts on this port It is only used for membership communication between LR hosts.
Client: Client Console
Client: Common Components
Persistence layer for time-series metrics

LogRhythm has been designed with a highly flexible modular architecture. Each key LogRhythm function exists in a separate software program, or service.
A multitude of devices are generating thousands of raw logs in your network at every moment. These devices can include servers, firewalls, routers, network services, applications, and email systems. Depending on the device, the logs are generated in a wide variety of formats and can include information related to system health, user interaction with an application, and so on. All of this log data has varying degrees of importance, from mundane activity to a potential security compromise.
LogRhythm SIEM is a fully integrated Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution that processes this raw log data to make information available to you in a meaningful and uniform context. The following diagram shows the key LogRhythm components for collecting and processing logs: the Agents, the Data Processor, the AI Engine, and the Platform Manager.

The individual services are installed on hosts to create the overall LogRhythm solution. All LogRhythm services can be installed on a single server providing all LogRhythm capabilities or the services can be installed on separate servers in high performance and redundant configurations.

Changing the default SQL Server Collation from “SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS” is not supported and can leave your deployment in a non-working state.

LogRhythm Agents collect raw log data from various devices and also monitor hosts to gather forensic data. The Agents then send that collected data to Data Processors, which parse the raw logs into relevant metadata. For any logs that meet certain criteria (immediate operational, security, or compliance relevance), the Data Processor categorizes those important logs as ""Events."" For more information, see the
Understand the LogRhythm Architecture
topic in the SIEM Help.
In the Web Console, you can view the following types of data:
Events
. The high-level data shown on the Dashboards page. Events typically include logs that indicate errors, failures, or attacks. Either the Data Processor or the AI Engine (if integrated) can classify a log as an event:
MPE Events
. Classified by the Data Processor's Message Processing Engine (MPE).
AIE Event
. Classified by the AIE's rules. Event data is displayed on the Dashboards in a variety of chart types.
MPE Events
. Classified by the Data Processor's Message Processing Engine (MPE).
AIE Event
. Classified by the AIE's rules. Event data is displayed on the Dashboards in a variety of chart types.
Metadata
. The parsed log data available in the Analyzer grid. Data Processors derive metadata from the raw logs, and when applicable, also add contextual information such as the known application or geographic location. Metadata can provide such information as impacted hosts, IP addresses, and origin of the data.
Raw Logs
. The unprocessed data sent from Agents. You can view the raw log by selecting an entry (row) in the grid and then clicking on the
Log Message
tab in the Details & Actions pane.
The Analyzer grid provides details on the log activities that generate events. Each line in the grid shows the metadata associated with a single event or log.

"Pivot searches offer two methods for building and running searches based on event metadata. You can run a pivot search from the Analyzer grid or from a TopX widget in the Dashboard. A pivot search from the Analyzer grid defaults to the log date and time, while a pivot search from a TopX widget defaults to the current time and date. Additionally, a pivot search from the Analyzer grid displays results for all metadata that go into the poly fields Host and Application. Host has the values Known Host, Hostname, and IP Address, while Application has the values Known Application, TCP/UDP port, and Protocol. A pivot search from a TopX widget only allows you to search the exact value shown in the widget.
To run a pivot search:
Do one of the following:
On either the Dashboards page or Analyze page, on the lower-right side of the page, click the
Logs
tab to open the Analyzer grid.
Hover your mouse over the metadata field containing the value that you want to search.
A Configuration icon appears in the field.
Click the

The Search feature includes a wide range of filter and group selections along with Boolean logic for targeting specific data sets. Search results are displayed on the Analyze page, where you can view the queried information in charts and graphs.
The tail option in search allows you to set up real-time queries that show whether logs or events matching a query are actively being generated and entering the system.
When searching by keyword, the term you enter needs to be an exact match with the item you are searching for. For example, if you wanted to search for ""Global Admin"" users, you would need to type
Global Admin
into the Search field. To run searches for all items containing a particular term, you need to include the prefix sql: and insert wildcard symbols (%) as appropriate. For example, if you wanted to run a keyword search for all users with ""admin"" somewhere in their titles, you would type
sql:%admin%
into the Search field.
When searching the Log Message field,
sql:
and
%
are not required.
The only required parameter for running a search is a time frame for your results.
Note that in deployments utilizing multiple Web Consoles, users can only access search or drill down results on the Web Console server from which the search or drill down originated. For example, if you perform a search on Web Console A and then log in to Web Console B, the search initiated on server A will not be available to you.

The following table describes the search filters available from the Search lists.
Search Filter
Account by Active Directory Group
The accounts with an Active Directory Group that are the recipients of the action.

"The Object Permissions Manager enables a Global Administrator or a Restricted Administrator with elevated privileges to manage secured objects (Investigations, Tails, Lists, and Alarm Rules). It enables the administrator to set new read and write access permissions for an object and to assign it to a new owner and/or entity.
For information on granting elevated privileges to a Restricted Administrator, see
Modify User Profile Management Permissions
.

Before assigning permissions to an object, it is important to understand how permissions in LogRhythm behave. The Read Access permissions override the Write Access permissions. For example, if the Read Access permissions are set to Private, the Write Access permissions cannot be set to anything other than Private.
The Read permissions have to be less restrictive than the Write Permissions. The Read permissions cannot be set to Private if the Write permissions are set to Public All.

"User Profiles enable an administrator to group access permissions for hosts and Log Sources so they can be assigned to more than one user at a time.

The LogRhythm Global Administrator and LogRhythm Global Analyst are default system user profiles. They are automatically created by and enabled. These user profiles have access to the following:
Entities
Log Sources
Data Processors
Global AI Engine Events that Span Entities
SecondLook
Security Roles
New profiles can be created for the Global Administrator, Global Analyst, Restricted Administrator, Restricted Analyst, and SOAP API Service Administrator security roles. The security roles enable the administrator to assign access to specific objects within the Entity to individual users. For example, a number of Restricted Analysts can be given access to Entity A, but not access to the same Log Sources within Entity A. Restricted Analyst 1 can have access to Log Sources 1, 2, and 3 on Entity A, while Restricted Analyst 2 has access to Log Sources 4, 5, and 6 on Entity A. Note:
While users are granted access to CloudAI through the User Profile Properties dialog box in the Client Console, CloudAI data is available only through the Web Console and the CloudAI Interface. To use the CloudAI, you must purchase a license. Granting permission to the CloudAI without a license has no effect on your deployment. Contact your Customer Relationship Manager to learn more and/or to sign up for these services.

The Global Administrator security role is granted access to all Entities, Data Processors, Log Sources, and SmartResponse Plugins. There can only be one Global Administrator security role.
The Global Administrator security role can be granted permission to the following:
Case Management
CloudAI

The Global Analyst security role is granted access to all Entities, Data Processors, Log Sources, and SmartResponse Plugins.
The Global Analyst security role can be granted permission to the following:
Case Management
CloudAI

The Restricted Administrator is granted access to specific Entities, Log Sources, and Data Processors. This security role can be configured with access to Global AI Engine Events or to a subset of AIE Events based on Entities and Child Entities. This enables large deployments to restrict access and provide filtering when Entity-based data segregation is enabled.
The Restricted Administrator security role has Log Source access rights applied at the following levels:
Case Management
Entities
Log Sources
Data Processors
The Restricted Administrator security role can be customized and granted permission to anything the Global Administrator security role has access to. Multiple Restricted Administrator profiles can be created, each with access to different administrative functions.

"An Entity represents a physical location where LogRhythm is deployed. It is used to organize the deployment and contain network and host records and LogRhythm components. In small, single-site deployments, one Entity record may be enough, but deployments that span many sites require multiple Entity records.

The Global Entity is part of every deployment and is used to declare hosts and networks residing outside internal or organic networks. The Message Processing Engine (MPE) uses this information to match rules and create Events. For example, a network range could be defined for an IP address range prone to security risks. Then you could create Alarm Rules to notify someone each time the internal IDS registered an attack from these IPs. For more information, see
Global Risk Based Priority
.
Users may not remove the Global Entity or perform tasks such as deploying Data Processors or Agents in it. Such tasks can only be performed within user-created Entities.
The Global Entity is intentionally unlisted except in the Deployment Manager, in the Entity tab where it is always at the top of the tree.

In every deployment, a Primary Site Entity is listed after the Global Entity. It is the default, user-definable Entity. If you have the proper credentials, you can modify its name and properties and add additional Entities.

The Message Processing Engine (MPE) uses Network and Host records to set the Risk-Based Priority (RBP) and to associate the log and associated event to a known host. The Entity acts as a boundary for the MPE. The MPE only analyzes a log message against the Network and Host records of the Entity where the sending Agent is assigned. For example, if the sending Agent is assigned to the Site1 Entity, the MPE only analyzes log messages against Network and Host records that are also assigned to Site1. It is very important to keep this in mind when you create the Entity structure and assign Agents, Networks, and Host records.
If you have sites that have overlapping IP space, you must create separate entity records for each site.

An Origin and Impacted Entity is assigned to every log message based on the following hierarchy:
Use the Entity associated with resolved Known Host.
Use the Entity associated with resolved Known Network.
Use the IP Address:
If there is an IP Private address, use Root Entity of Log Source Host.
If there is an IP Public address, use the Global Entity.
If there is no IP address, use Root Entity of Log SourceHost.
If there is an IP Private address, use Root Entity of Log Source Host.
If there is an IP Public address, use the Global Entity.
If there is no IP address, use Root Entity of Log SourceHost.
This approach assumes an unresolved IP address that is not resolved to a known host or network, which is not a Private IP address, is most likely an external address and should be assigned to the Global Entity.
The Entity resolution performed in the MPE assigns Origin and Impacted Entity based on finding matching Host Identifiers assigned to Hosts in the respective Entities and DOES NOT fall back to matching on network ranges assigned to Networks. Furthermore, the Origin and Impacted Entity values resolved by the MPE are what gets saved to a Data Indexer record.
The Origin and Impacted Entity Networks are determined by matching on network ranges for Networks defined in the entity structure.

The Reorganization Wizard provides a method for LogRhythm administrators to migrate Host and Network records between Entities. This enables logical restructuring of the log management system to match real-world changes in network topology and system placement.

"Endpoint Monitoring is a client/server information security (IS) methodology used to audit log files generated by endpoint devices, such as laptops, smartphones, and routers. Endpoint monitoring collects the generated log files and sends them to the Data Processor for analysis. If unusual behavior is detected, an alarm is generated.
LogRhythm endpoint monitoring has six features. Each feature is used to monitor a different type of endpoint.
File Integrity Monitor (FIM).
Monitors critical database and application files for unauthorized changes. FIM provides independent auditing of access to and modification of files and directories. When FIM detects a change, a System Monitor Agent generates a log and sends it to the Data Processor where you can manage it like any other log. Logs can be forwarded to LogMart and the Platform Manager, can generate alarms, and can be included in reports.
Registry Integrity Monitor (RIM).
Provides independent, realtime auditing of modifications to Windows registries. When RIM detects a change, the System Monitor Agent generates a log and sends it to the Data Processor where it can manage it like any other log. The logs can be forwarded to LogMart and to the Platform Manager so alarms can be generated and included in reports.
Data Loss Defender (DLD).
Independently monitors and logs the connection and disconnection of external data devices to the host computer where the Agent is running. It also monitors and logs the transmission of files to an external storage device. You can configure DLD to protect against external data device connections by ejecting specified devices upon detection. External USB drive storage devices include Flash/RAM drives and CD/DVD drives.
Process Monitor.
Independently monitors when processes start and end on a Windows or UNIX host where the Agent is running. The Agent generates one log when a process starts on the host (log includes process name, owner name, and start time, duration, etc.) and another log when the Agent detects the process has stopped. If enabled, the Process Monitor logs contain UAM information to log what users were connected to the host at the time the process was started/stopped.
Network Connection Monitor (NCM).
Independently monitors when network connections are opened and closed on a Windows or UNIX host where a LogRhythm Agent is running and configured to do so. The Agent generates a log when a connection opens on the host (log includes protocol, local IP address and port, remote IP address and port, open time, close time, duration, etc.) and another log when the Agent detects the connection has been closed. If enabled, the Network Connection Monitor logs contain UAM information to log what users were connected to the host at the time the connection was opened/closed.
User Activity Monitor (UAM).
Used in conjunction with File Integrity Monitor. The UAM tracks when a user logs on to and off a Windows or UNIX host. The login time can then be compared to any FIM activities that occur.

"A Log Source is a unique source of log data that is collected from a Host. Every log is associated to a single Log Source which is the key link LogRhythm uses to determine the origin of a log message. Hosts can have one or more Log Sources.
A typical Windows Server Host has the following Log Sources:
System Event Logs
Application Event Logs
Security Event Logs
System Event Logs
Application Event Logs
Security Event Logs
On a Linux system, an example of a log source would be a Messages Syslog File.
Log Sources are centrally administered through the LogRhythm Client Console. This includes creating Source records and configuring parameters that affect how the Agent collection process functions. After configuration, the settings are pushed out to Agents at each heartbeat communication. Only Global Admins or Restricted Admins with elevated View and Manage privileges can take this action.
Backwards Compatibility
Starting with the 7.4.3 System Monitor Agent, in order to collect new log sources via the API, the only component that must be at the latest version is the System Monitor. Your core deployment (Mediator, Platform Manager, etc.) can be at any 7.3.x version or above. The only exception to this is the Office 365 Message Tracking log source type which requires a 7.4.x core version. All other API log sources will allow you to use a 7.4.3 agent to collect if your core is at least version 7.3.x.

"Log Source Types are used to classify logs that come from common hardware or have the same data format and operate under the same processing rules. Using a Log Source Type improves processing performance because logs are only processed against rules for that type. Rules for other Log Sources Types are automatically skipped.
Examples of a Log Source Type:
An in-house software application
The Windows Application Event Log
One Log Source Type is assigned to each Log Message Source and to collections of rules defined in Log Processing Policies. That way, LogRhythm knows which rules can be assigned to which Log Message Sources.

"Administrators can group load-balanced System Monitors together when multiple System Monitors are connected to a commercial or open source round-robin load balancer.
When System Monitor Agents are configured into a Load Balanced Agent Group, all parent and child syslog virtual log sources assigned to one collection Agent in the group appear in all scsm.ini files for Agents in that group. This feature allows all System Monitor Agents within the group to immediately recognize identifiers for all log sources within the group. This prevents log loss that can happen during virtual identifier search scope lookups.

"Data Processor pooling makes it easy for administrators to distribute log volume across a pool of Data Processors and create well-balanced Data Indexer clusters.
Administrators can quickly define Data Processor pools, assign Data Processors to those pools, and then configure agents to send logs to all Data Processors in the pool. Agents assigned to a DP pool use a round robin based log flushing mechanism to evenly distribute their logs across the Data Processors in the pool. One
Data Processor in the pool is designated to receive heartbeats and
message source states. If the control DP is unreachable or offline, the Agent will designate another Data Processor in the pool as the control DP.
Data Processor Pooling applies to all log sources and log types collected by an Agent.

Starting with version 7.13, Data Processor pooling is available to customers with multiple Data Processors in their deployment.
Data Processor Pooling mode is not enabled for deployments or agents on versions prior to 7.13. In such cases, Administrators can configure the Agent to pinned mode, which sends logs to a single Data Processor.

"Host records identify and assign useful information to important systems in your network. When analyzing log messages and creating events, the MPE tries to associate the actors involved in the event such as the source IP of an event to a known host. If a known host can be identified, the risk threshold identified by the host records is used to create the Risk-Based Priority (RBP). If a host record is not found, the network risk threshold is used. Host records are also good places to add information such as the purpose of the system, any known issues, and key contacts.

Host names within Entities should be unique. However, some sites may have hosts in two different entities that have identical host names or host name identifiers as shown in the following diagram.

When the situation that is shown in the preceding diagram occurs, an additional step is required in LogRhythm to allow an unregistered agent to auto-register. A LogRhythm administrator must specify the EntityID in the General section of the scsm.ini file in the format:
[General]
EntityID=X
When the EntityID is present, the agent sends this to the mediator in its identification message (otherwise known as the agent info string). In an example where the EntityID=5, the agent info string sent to the mediator will look like:
HOSTGUID=00093D13802A,HOSTNAME=platinum.schq.secious.com,VERSION=1.2.3.4,OS=Linux,OSVERSION=2.6.23.17,IPS=[10.1.1.38],CLIENTADDRESS=10.1.1.38,CPU=0.40,MEMORY=3785445376,MEMORYFREE=3230511104,AGENTMEMORYUSED=0,AGENTCPU=0,DISKIDLE=0,DISK=0,DISKFREE=0,ENTITYID=5

Known Hosts are specific devices and hosts that are entered in LogRhythm to:
Provide a consolidated roll-up of log message activity.
Be used in the calculation of Risk Based Priority and Direction.
Be available as criteria for all filtering functions across the product.
Log messages are associated to Known Hosts based on host identifiers in the log. The identifiers can be: Windows Host Name(s), DNS Host Name(s), and IP Address(s). When applicable, host is searched for first by host name then IP.

Hosts and Networks are also assigned a Zone value of Internal, External, or DMZ. The Zone is assigned in the order:
Zone of the resolved Known Host.
Zone of the resolved Network.
The IP address:
If the IP Address is private, set the Zone to Internal.
If the IP Address is public, set the Zone to External.
If there is no IP Address, set the Zone to Unknown.
If the IP Address is private, set the Zone to Internal.
If the IP Address is public, set the Zone to External.
If there is no IP Address, set the Zone to Unknown.

A Direction is assigned to log messages when the zone of both Origin and Impacted Host is known.
Origin Zone Internal and Impacted Zone Internal
Origin Zone DMZ and Impacted Zone Internal
Origin Zone Internal and Impacted Zone DMZ
Origin Zone DMZ and Impacted Zone DMZ
Origin Zone Internal and Impacted Zone External
Origin Zone DMZ and Impacted Zone External
No value for both Origin and Impacted Host
Origin Zone undetermined
Impacted Zone undetermined
Unidentified logs

Global Administrators can add hosts to an entity in batch using a clipboard paste/copy option or importing from an existing file of hosts. The clipboard functionality uses the Windows copy/paste feature. Whatever you copy from a document is pasted into the Host Import Manager when you select that option. You can then review what has been pasted and choose to accept or reject. When adding hosts from the clipboard, hosts are added to the selected Entity. The file functionality allows you to import data from an existing file in a specified format. The feature allows you to review the hosts that were pasted from the clipboard or hosts that were imported from a file prior to persisting them to your LogRhythm Deployment.

When batch importing Host Records, the Host Import Manager appears. The Host Import Manager grid contains the following columns.

The Status column displays different values based on the record being imported and its current existence in your deployment. The table below outlines the outcome of Host Record Analysis and its associated status value.
Warning Type 4: Host exists for another Entity within the specified Entity family and is retired. Creating a new Host with the same identifiers is not recommended. Select the action you would like to take for this Host within the Warning Type 4 Acceptance Mode control.
When a Warning Type 4 is experienced, there is an Acceptance Mode on the Host Import Manager that allows you to choose an action to take for the host record with that warning type.

"You can configure the Windows System Monitor Pro or Collector Agent to collect data from database tables, usually targeting tables that contain database audit or log data. LogRhythm stores the data from a table row as a log to allow analysis tools such as Investigator or Tail to review the information. Universal Database Log Adapter (UDLA) logs are treated as any other log types; they can be forwarded as events, associated with alarms, and archived.


Two database table prerequisites must be met before LogRhythm can collect data. The table must have:
Either a primary key column or a concatenation of columns that creates a unique identifier for each row.
A column with an incrementing integer or a date/time stamp so that the table order can be determined.
A single column may be able to satisfy both requirements. The System Monitor Pro or Collector Agent uses the concept of state to know which rows of data have been collected from a table by tracking table sequence and by using the unique identifier. If a column is an auto-incrementing number for each row, and therefore unique in the table, it both defines the order of the data and provides the unique identifier. It can be used in the Unique Identifier Field and in the State Field of the UDLA settings.
For example, when a table has a primary key column which contains a unique, increasing value, this column can be used for the Unique Identifier Field and the State Field.
This sample contains one day of log traffic, where an event was logged every six hours.

An event has occurred.
Corresponding UDLA Settings:
Unique Identifier Field
Key
State Field
Key
State Field Type
Increment
When there is no primary key column, a concatenation of columns can be used if doing so uniquely identifies all rows. Here, the System Monitor Pro or Collector Agent tracks collection state by using the unique identifier plus the State Field, which must either be an increasing integer or date/time stamp.
For example, given the table below with the columns Date, Time, and Log, the concatenation of the Date and Time columns meet the prerequisite for a unique identifier. The State Field must always either be an incrementing integer or a date/time stamp, so the Date column meets the other requirement.
This sample contains one day of log traffic, where an event was logged every six hours.

"FIM provides independent auditing of access to and modification of files and directories. It is intended for monitoring operating system files and other limited, critical files that, when changed, suggest systems have been compromised.
The purpose of FIM is to monitor integrity (not activity) though mechanisms, such independent hash verification, that tend to be resource intensive, which is why FIM has limited use.
For example, customers using Windows may want to monitor .exe and .dll files in
C:\Windows\System32
and
C:\Windows\SysWOW64
. FIM is not suitable for use on large directories with thousands of files that are modified frequently. Enabling FIM on directories with tens of GB of data results in poor performance. Customers may want to filter for a
ccounts such as localsystem, network service, and trustedinstaller to prevent FIM from logging normal system behavior and Windows Updates. However, FIM configuration should always be based on your organizational need and auditing requirements.
The recommended file limits for FIM usage are as follows:
10 files of 1 Gb each
1,000 files of 1Mb each
98,990 files of 1 Kb each

When FIM detects a change, a System Monitor Agent generates a log and sends it to the Data Processor where you can manage it like any other log. Logs can be forwarded to LogMart and the Platform Manager, can generate alarms, and can be included in reports.
A LogRhythm File Integrity Monitor log message source type is automatically created for each agent on first connection to the Mediator. There are
Generic System Log Sources
for Windows and *NIX agents, and they are associated with the LogRhythm Default policy which contains all available MPE rules. For information on accessing and modifying the log source type, see
Modify a Single Log Source
.
A LogRhythm Default policy exists for File Integrity Monitor in the Knowledge Base file. To access the Log Processing Policy and its associated MPE Rules, see
Modify Log Processing Policies
.
MPE Rules exist for File Integrity Monitor in the MPE Rule Builder. Specific settings can be viewed and modified from within the File Integrity Monitor Log Processing Policy.
File Integrity Monitor logs can be queried using Investigator, monitored in Personal Dashboard and Tail, and restored using LogRhythm’s Archive Restoration tool SecondLook.

There are two types of File Integrity Monitoring: Standard (FIM) and Realtime (Realtime FIM). Standard and Realtime FIM are both included with the System Monitor Lite license for desktop operating systems only. Server operating systems require System Monitor Pro or Collector. For more information about specific operating system support, see the
Realtime File Integrity Monitor (FIM) Support by Operating System
topic in the LogRhythm Compatibility and System Monitor Functionality Guide.
Realtime FIM
Access Control Lists (ACLs)
File Attributes (Read-only/Hidden/System)

To use standard FIM, you need to:
Install a System Monitor Lite Agent on a desktop operating system or a System Monitor Pro or Collector Agent on a server operating system
Create the File Integrity Monitor Policy
or
Modify the File Integrity Monitor Policy
Configure the System Monitor Agent Properties

Realtime File Integrity Monitoring (Realtime FIM) is an event-driven model that provides real-time accuracy and enables precise user identification. This feature provides exact identification of the process that performed the change, enabling precise identification of the user as well. Standard FIM scans the directories on an interval and then alarms when a change to a file's hash is detected. Depending on how many directories are being monitored, it may even take slightly longer than the configured interval for the Agent to hash all your files and alert you of a change.
To use Realtime FIM, you need to:
Install a System Monitor Lite Agent on a desktop operating system or a System Monitor Pro or Collector Agent on a server operating system
Create the File Integrity Monitor Policy
or
Modify the File Integrity Monitor Policy
Configure the System Monitor Agent Properties
Realtime FIM cannot monitor files on a network drive using a UNC path.
On recent versions of Windows, the Last Access timestamp may be disabled by default, and it is required to ensure that read events trigger a Realtime FIM event. To check this setting, run
fsutil behavior query disablelastaccess
in an elevated command prompt. If DisableLastAccess is set to 1, you will need to enable it by running
fsutil behavior set disablelastaccess 0
in the same elevated command prompt.
To ensure that Realtime FIM works as expected on Linux and AIX operating systems, please note the following prerequisites.
The audit subsystem needs to be enabled for the LogRhythm System Monitor to correctly perform Realtime FIM on Linux. You can query the status of the subsystem by running the following command: auditctl –s
The ""e"" value indicates if audit is enabled. A value of 1 indicates that audit is enabled, and 0 is disabled.
If needed, you can enable audit by running the following command: auditctl –e 1
Ensure that the audit subsystem is enabled at startup on the system where the System Monitor is running.
RealTimeFIM feature on AgentU uses the system auditd service to collect logs for monitoring. Due to an architectural limitation on Linux, only one instance of auditd can be active. Therefore, if RealTimeFIM is enabled, /var/log/audit/audit.log won't be collected.
To ensure proper operation of Realtime FIM on AIX, please note the following:
libstdc++ 4.8.3 or newer must be installed for the System Monitor to start.
If needed, modify /etc/security/audit/config to be sure that it contains the following:
classes:
files = FILE_Open,FILE_Read,FILE_Write,FILE_Close,FILE_Link,FILE_Unlink,FILE_Rename,FILE_Owner,FILE_Mode,FILE_Acl,FILE_Privilege,DEV_Create
users:
[for every user] = general,files
After modifying /etc/security/audit/config, restart the audit service and verify the audit object section has been updated permanently.
classes:
files = FILE_Open,FILE_Read,FILE_Write,FILE_Close,FILE_Link,FILE_Unlink,FILE_Rename,FILE_Owner,FILE_Mode,FILE_Acl,FILE_Privilege,DEV_Create

users:
[for every user] = general,files
After modifying /etc/security/audit/config, restart the audit service and verify the audit object section has been updated permanently.
There can be many entries under the users section, one for each user. If a user entry does not contain the files parameter, file activity by that user cannot be monitored.

The modifications that trigger FIM logs depend on the operating system where the host agent is installed. FIM is available on all operating systems supported by the LogRhythm *NIX and Windows System Monitor Agents. Realtime FIM is supported on desktop and server platforms with the appropriate license. The following table provides details.

On Windows systems, FIM categorizes files sent to the Recycle Bin (for example, by right-clicking the file and clicking
Delete
) as renamed instead of deleted. If you bypass the recycle bin when deleting a file (for example, press
Shift
+
Delete
), FIM logs the DELETE change.
FIM is centrally managed from the LogRhythm Console. The defined monitoring policy can be used by multiple agents; thus,
filemon.cfg
no longer needs to be edited for each agent host.
Due to limitations in the Windows Cache Manager, reads performed by applications that use Memory-mapped files are not always seen by file system filters such as the one used by Realtime FIM in the Windows System Monitor Agent. Notepad and WordPad are two such applications. Consequently, some reads by these applications, and other applications that use Memory-mapped files, are not reported.
In some cases, Linux realtime FIM reports a large number of events for a single operation. If there is an operation on a very large file, the Linux realtime FIM module may report each read and write as the file is being processed for an operation. The agent may seem to be reporting a large number of events, but the agent is reporting each and every file system access performed by the operation.
The MODIFY events that are reported by Linux realtime FIM indicate content changes to that file. A single application operation (wget, scp, etc) may generate multiple MODIFY events that indicate that Linux is updating the file multiple times.

There are four categories of Agent Event(s): Discrete, Cumulative, Multiple Change, and Anomaly. Discrete Events have a one to one correspondence with the RealTime FIM Records which cause them to be generated. Cumulative Events are multiple RealTime FIM Records combined into a single Event. Multiple Change Events are multiple Agent Events generated by a single RealTime FIM Record. Anomaly Events can occur independently of RealTime FIM Records. Multiple Change and Anomaly Events are SubTyped Events.

Discrete Events have a one to one correspondence with the RealTime FIM Records which cause them to be generated. All Event types that aren’t Cumulative, Multiple Change, or Anomaly Events are Discrete Events.
An evCreate record for a file that didn’t previously exist will generate a CreateOpEvent which has the Event ID “EVENT=ADD”.

An evClose on a file which has had the delete flag set will result in a test for the existence of the file. If the file no longer exists, a DeleteEvent is generated, which has the Event ID “EVENT=DELETE”.

Cumulative Events are multiple RealTime FIM Records combined into a single Event. ReadWriteEvent and its derivatives are currently the only Cumulative Events.
A ReadEvent, derived from ReadWriteEvent, has the Event ID “EVENT=READ”. The first evRead Record following a non-Read Record generates a ReadEvent, but the Event is not forwarded, in order to coalesce any subsequent adjacent evRead Records. Until there is a record that is not evRead, each subsequent record is checked for adjacency with the previous Read Record(s) and coalesced with the previous one(s) by adding the length from the current record to the cumulative length for the pending ReadEvent. A non-Read Record or a Read Record with a non-adjacent location will cause the ReadEvent to be forwarded to the Mediator and processing to resume on the next Record as the initial Record in a new Event.

A WriteEvent, derived from ReadWriteEvent, has the Event ID “EVENT=MODIFY”. The first evWrite Record following a non-Write Record generates a WriteEvent, but the Event is not forwarded, in order to coalesce any subsequent adjacent evWrite Records. Until there is a record that is not evWrite, each subsequent record is check for adjacency with the previous Write Record(s) and coalesced with the previous one(s) by adding the length from the current record to the cumulative length for the pending WriteEvent. A non-Write Record or a Write Record with a non-adjacent location will cause the WriteEvent to be forwarded to the Mediator and processing to resume on the next Record as the initial Record in a new Event.

SubTyped Events are multiple Event definitions with a single Event ID. They contain Type and Description fields that other Events do not have.

Multiple Change Events are multiple Events generated by a single RealTime FIM Record. Multiple Change Events have a CHANGESET field that is unique to the RealTime FIM Record that generated them. PermissionsChangeEvent and AttributeChangeEvent and their derivatives are Multiple Change Events. Multiple Change Events are SubTyped Events, with Type and Description fields.
The Attribute Change Event is a Multiple Change Event due to the fact that multiple Attributes can be changed with a single operation on the File System, which will show up as a single RealTime FIM Record, but it is desirable to have them appear as separate Event messages. An AttributeChangeEvent has the Event ID “EVENT=ATTRIB”. The AttributeChangeEvent is a SubTyped Event. The label for the Type field is “ATTRIB_TYPE”. The label for the Description field is “ATTRIB_DESC”. The supported Attributes are Read-only, Hidden, and System. There are separate events for Set and Clear of each Attribute.
A ReadOnlyAttributeSetEvent has the Event ID “EVENT=ATTRIB”. The ATTRIB_TYPE field is 001, and the ATTRIB_DESC field is “Read-only Attribute Set”.

The Permission Change Event is a Multiple Change Event due to the fact that multiple Permissions can be changed with a single operation on the File System, which will show up as a single RealTime FIM Record, but it is desirable to have them appear as separate Event messages. A PermissionChangeEvent has the Event ID “EVENT=PERMS”. The PermissionChangeEvent is a SubTyped Event. The label for the Type field is “PERMS_TYPE”. The label for the Description field is “PERMS_DESC”. The supported Permissions are Owner, Group, Discretionary ACL, and System ACL. There is a single Event for each Permission type.

Anomaly Events can be generated independently of any RealTime FIM Records, or in conjunction with one or more Records. The AnomalyEvent has the Event ID “EVENT=ANOMALY”. Anomaly Events are SubTyped Events. The label for the Type field is “ANOMALY_TYPE”. The label for the Description field is “ANOMALY_DESC”. The supported Anomaly types are Hash Equal and Missed Modify Anomalies.
A HashEqualAnomalyEvent has the Event ID “EVENT=ANOMALY”. The ANOMALY_TYPE is 001. The ANOMALY_DESC is “Modification observed with unchanged file hash”.

When file or folder permissions are added, modified, or deleted, Realtime FIM logs the following details:
Origin Logon
. The account ID of the user who made the change.
Change Made
. The type of access that was granted (for example, read, write, full, etc.).
Affected File or Folder
. The file or folder upon which permissions were changed (for example, C:\users\john.doe\file.tmp).
User or Group Granted Access
. The user ID or user group that was granted access.
Within the Realtime FIM logs, associated permissions are comma-delimited, a separate log is generated for each account impacted by the change, and each log contains a RESULT field that describes the file permissions resulting from the change. The following examples illustrate how Realtime FIM logs added, deleted, or changed permissions.

You can create new FIM policies using the File Integrity Monitor Policy Manager. The LogRhythm deployment also includes default policy templates for each supported operating system. These templates are examples of policies that can be created. Using them without modifying them to fit your specific needs is not recommended. For more information, see

Field/Button
Description
Name
The name of the configuration. It must be unique.
Enable Start/Stop Time
Select the check box to set monitoring to start and stop at the time specified every day.
Start Time
Select the hour and minute that monitoring should start each day. This field cannot be edited unless the Enable Start/Stop Time check box is selected.
Stop Time
Select the hour and minute that monitoring should stop each day. This field cannot be edited unless the Enable Start/Stop Time check box is selected.
Interval
Set the frequency, in minutes, of the monitoring interval. Range is 1 - 10080 minutes.
Max Hashed File Bytes
Set the maximum file size, in kilobytes, that FIM reviews for changes. If the files being monitored are over 1MB, using this value can save time by specifying how much of each file to view. For example, if Max Hashed File Bytes is set to 1024, only the first 1024 KBytes of the file will be checked for changes.
Max Depth
Applies only when the monitored item is a directory and controls the number of subdirectories the monitor descends to detect changes. Max Depth specifies how many subdirectories below a monitored directory to look for FIM events.
EXAMPLE
The monitored directory is C:\DirA
The Max Depth =2
Host directory structure is C:\DirA\DirB\DirC
The Agent travels two directories below C:\DirA looking for FIM events. Files in:
C:\DirA are at depth 0
C:\DirA\DirB are at depth 1
C:\DirA\DirB\DirC are at depth 2
Monitoring Flags
Indicates when FIM logs are generated:
Read
. Monitored item is read. This option may generate a large number of logs.
Modify
. Monitored item is modified.
When FIM is monitoring for Modify events, the HashEqualAnomalyEvent is generated if a monitored file is modified and the file's hash value is unchanged.
Permissions
. Permissions are changed on a monitored item.
Add
. Item is added to the monitored directory. The Add option cannot be disabled.
Delete
. Monitored item is deleted. The Delete option cannot be disabled.
OK

Field/Button
Description
Type
Select File or Directory
Path
Specify the path of the directory or the location and file name of the file to monitor. Cannot include a wildcard.
Configuration
Select from the monitoring configurations created for this policy.
Inclusions
A comma-separated list of files and directories to include in monitoring. If nothing is specified, all files and directories are monitored. Applies only to directories to define what is monitored and triggers FIM logs.
To determine your inclusions:
Identify the files and directories that should be monitored within your network. LogRhythm supports file names and directory paths up to approximately 32,000 characters in length.
File Integrity Monitor is not suitable for use on large directories with thousands of files that are modified frequently. It is intended for monitoring operating system files and other limited, critical files. Enabling FIM on directories with tens of GB of data results in poor performance. The default policies, shown in the templates in the FIM Policy Manager, are limited to Windows system files, which are fairly static.
Determine which changes are important to monitor for files:
READ. When a file is accessed.
The File Integrity Monitor does not always capture Read events on monitored files for Windows 2008 R2, Vista, or Windows 2003 Server
MODIFY. When a file is edited.
PERMISSIONS:
For Windows, when a file owner, group, or ACL changes.
For UNIX, when a file owner is changed or file permissions are changed.
DELETE. When a file is deleted. This setting is automatic and cannot be canceled.
Determine which changes are important to monitor for directories:
PERMISSIONS:
For Windows, when a directory has an owner change or when a file within the directory has an owner change.
For UNIX, when a directory has an owner or permissions change or a file within a directory has an owner or permissions change.
DELETE. When a file is deleted from a directory. The setting is automatic and cannot be canceled.
ADD. When a file is added to a directory. This setting is automatic and cannot be canceled.
If you are running Windows 2008 or Windows 2008 R2 and want to monitor the C:\Documents and Settings directory, changes are not seen because it is a junction point to C:\Users. Instead, enter the folder C:\Users when setting up the directory monitoring.
If you want to monitor a type of file created by an application that creates temporary files (such as Microsoft Word documents .docx), you need to monitor the parent directory of the modified file directory instead of the specific file type.
Exclusions
A comma-separated list of files and directories to include in monitoring. Applies only to directories to define what is monitored and triggers FIM logs. If both include and exclude filters are specified, only include files that match the include filter and not matching the exclude filter.
Exclusions take precedence over Inclusions. If you mistakenly put the same file type in both categories, the file type is excluded from the monitoring process.
It is important to identify resource-taxing FIM objects and create exclusions for them. For example, you want to identify automated scripting objects that are constantly changing.

A monitored item that is a directory has inclusions and exclusions that are applied to the files within it.
A monitored item that is a file cannot have inclusions and exclusions. Individual files cannot have filters applied to them.
When an include filter is applied to a directory, the filter is applied to the parent directory and all the child directories and files within those directories. For example, if an include filter is applied to the Documents directory to monitor document files, FIM monitors all the files in the Document directory and the subdirectories whether those files are document files or files of other types, as long as they match an include filter and don’t match an exclude filter.
If a subdirectory of the Document directory has an exclude filter applied to it, that directory and its child directories are ignored.
In the graphic below, all the directories highlighted in green are affected by the included filter; they are monitored. When the LogRhythm Agent encounters an exclude filter for a subdirectory (represented by the red highlight), the files in the subdirectory and its child directories are ignored.



Wildcard Required
A wildcard is always required and can appear multiple times in Inclusions and Exclusions lists. The only wildcard allowed in a filter is the asterisk (*), as shown in these examples:
*.exe
*access*.log
*/logs/
data.*
*\$NtUninstallKB*$\
C:\Windows\$NtUninstall*\
A wildcard is always required and can appear multiple times in Inclusions and Exclusions lists. The only wildcard allowed in a filter is the asterisk (*), as shown in these examples:
*.exe
*access*.log
*/logs/
data.*
*\$NtUninstallKB*$\
C:\Windows\$NtUninstall*\
Lists
The list items must be separated with either commas or semicolons and cannot contain spaces.
For example:
*.txt,access.*,$NtUninstall*$,*access*.log,*.*
*.txt,access.*;$NtUninstall*$;*access*.log,*.*
The list items must be separated with either commas or semicolons and cannot contain spaces.
For example:
*.txt,access.*,$NtUninstall*$,*access*.log,*.*
*.txt,access.*;$NtUninstall*$;*access*.log,*.*

Each file and directory and fully qualified path is evaluated against the include and exclude filters independently. When the directory monitored item has a Max Depth greater than 0, each subdirectory level is evaluated before traveling deeper into the directory structure. Additionally, the LogRhythm Agent appends a backslash (\) to all Windows directories or a forward slash (/) to all UNIX directories before applying the filters.
For example, if you want to exclude all subdirectories ending with debug under the root monitored directory C:\Temp, the exclude filter to use is:
(Note the trailing backslash.)
rather than
Filters are applied to the fully qualified path, not just the right-most element of the path.

If only an include filter is specified, the results include only the files and directories matching the include filter.
If only an exclude filter is specified, the results include only the files and directories
not
matching the exclude filter.
If both include and exclude filters are specified, files and directories that match the exclude filter are excluded regardless of whether they match the include filter.
If a directory matches an include filter, then all files directly within that directory are monitored, regardless of whether they also match the include filter. If those files then match an exclude filter, they are excluded.
If a file matches an include filter, but its directory does not match the filter, the file is monitored, unless the file also matches an exclude filter.
If a directory matches an exclude filter, then that directory and all its files and subdirectories are excluded.
You have the following directory structure and Max Depth = 1:

"The Registry Integrity Monitor (RIM) provides independent, realtime auditing of modifications to Windows registries. When RIM detects a change, the System Monitor Agent generates a log and sends it to the Data Processor where it can manage it like any other log. The logs can be forwarded to LogMart and to the Platform Manager so alarms can be generated and included in reports.
To configure RIM for a Windows Agent, four steps must be completed:
Create a Registry Integrity Monitor Policy
.
Configure Registry Integrity Monitor Policy Items
.
Associate Registry Integrity Monitor Policy Items to a Policy
.
Associate a Registry Integrity Monitor Policy to a Windows System Monitor Agent
.
Note the following considerations regarding RIM:
RIM is available for both Pro and Lite Desktop Windows Agents but only available on Pro Windows Server Agents. RIM is supported on Windows Vista/2008 and above.
RIM requires the installation of the Realtime File Integrity Monitor driver. For more information, see System Monitor Agent Installation.
Due to a known Windows limitation, the following may be observed with RENAME event handling:When a RENAME event is reported by RIM (for example, a key is renamed), it is reported properly with the old name and new name populated with the correct values. Subsequent operations on the renamed key, however, may be reported with the old name.
RIM events are not reported as HKEY_CURRENT_USER. They are always reported as HKEY_USERS\<User_SID>\. HKEY_CURRENT_USER is a symbolic link to the current user’s branch in the \Registry\User hive. For this reason, events reported from \Registry\User\<User_SID\ will be translated to HKEY_USERS\<User_SID>\.
Recurse Subkeys and Registry Integrity Monitor: If you have not enabled the Recurse Subkeys option on a RIM Policy item, the key value is reported but no events are reported on parent keys. To avoid this issue, ensure that Recurse Subkeys is enabled when adding a RIM Policy item.

"The System Monitor Configuration Policy Manager provides LogRhythm administrators policy-based management of Agents. A LogRhythm Administrator creates a System Monitor Configuration Policy and then applies the policy to multiple Agents. The policy determines how the Data Processor processes logs sent from the Agents.
When an Agent has a System Monitor Configuration Policy applied to it, the Agent's configuration is locked. The policy applied to the Agent must be updated to change the Agent’s configuration. By locking down the Agent’s configuration, the LogRhythm Administrator can easily control the configuration of many Agents over large geographic locations.

"The Windows Host Wizard connects to Active Directory to find Windows systems on the domain. Eligible systems returned by the scan can be selected for remote log collection. Correctly defined permissions are essential to identify systems and collect logs.
The wizard can only scan domains that have the Include in Scan option selected in the domain properties under Windows Host Wizard. For more information, see
Configure Initial Host Settings (Domain, Entity, and Log Source Types)
.

The Remote Registry service on Agent-less systems must be started for machines to be identified in the scan.
The user logged in to the machine where the scan is taking place must be a domain user on the domain being scanned or the scan will fail to run.

If firewalls are used on systems in your network:
To allow for remote log collection, an exception for port 443 must be added to the Windows Firewall settings on the Agent-less systems.
The Client Console machine should also have an exception for port 443.
To allow the host machine to be identified, the Remote Admin exception must be added to the Windows Firewall settings on the Agent-less systems. If it does not appear in the list of Programs and Services within Windows firewall exceptions tab, add it from a command prompt by typing the following command:
CODE
netsh firewall set service remoteadmin enable
To confirm it is enabled, type the following:
CODE
netsh firewall show state
To allow the host machine to be identified, the Remote Admin exception must be added to the Windows Firewall settings on the Agent-less systems. If it does not appear in the list of Programs and Services within Windows firewall exceptions tab, add it from a command prompt by typing the following command:

To collect logs remotely from another system, the collecting Agent’s service must be running under an account that is in the Event Log Readers group. For more information, refer to the
LogRhythm Guide: Least-Privileged User
.

The user running the scan must have administrator privileges on the system that is running the Client Console and for the systems on the domain from which logs will be collected. This can be achieved by setting up local users with Administrator rights or by using users with domain administrator privileges.

Any other settings on the systems related to firewall, permissions, or security may impact scanning, identification, or collection of event logs.

The following is a table of the allowable combinations for collection setup. The table provides the following parameters:
Agent Operating System
. Operating system of the machine where the agent is installed.
Log Message Source Host
. Machine from which the MS Event Logs will be collected.
Log Message Source Type
. Log Message Source Type selected for the Log Message Source Host.
Local Event Log Collection Allowed?
Whether the agent can collect the Log Message Source locally.
Remote Event Log Collection Allowed?
Whether the agent can collect the Log Message Source remotely.

"Current best practices dictate that all software be deployed with minimal user/account privileges. The Least-Privileged User approach helps reduce the potential impact if an attacker were to compromise a particular system or user account. This document describes the privilege footprint for typical LogRhythm deployments and provides guidance on how to restrict user permissions.
The LogRhythm SIEM runs as a set of services to support scalability and process isolation. Each service can run under a unique security context to enable greater flexibility in tuning privileges.

This document applies to the LogRhythm SIEM version 7.14.x. Future versions of LogRhythm may require additional changes or configuration settings based on new features.
Unless otherwise stated, settings may also be applicable for 6.3.8 and 6.3.3 installations. Earlier installations may have slight variations or may not have specific features in the System Monitors.

The LogRhythm SIEM runs as a set of independent services to support process isolation and scalability. Each service can run under a unique security context. This provides granularity of privilege assignment, along with the assurance that the service can only perform the functions for which it has been granted permission.
Both LogRhythm SIEM appliances and LogRhythm Software Solutions (LRSS) have a certified security policy applied during the build process as part of the standard LogRhythm hardening process. LogRhythm is also proud to hold the following certifications:

Defense Information System Agency (DISA) Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG)
Common Criteria EAL2+ (VID#10389)
FIPS 140-2
U.S. Army Certificate of Networthiness (CoN)

Although certifications have not been attained at this time, LogRhythm still provides guidance and configuration to support evaluation against each of the certifications listed in the previous section.

Defense Information System Agency (DISA) Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG)
Common Criteria EAL2+ (VID#10389)
FIPS 140-2
U.S. Army Certificate of Networthiness (CoN)
Several of these security standards have a direct impact on user privilege and may meet the needs of your enterprise without further changes. If you have questions about any of these certifications, contact LogRhythm for the current guidelines and certification statements.

A LogRhythm SIEM deployment contains the following types of user contexts:
Platform Manager (PM) Version 7 (Formerly Event Manager)
. The Platform Manager provides alarming, notifications, case and security incident management, workflow automation, and centralized administration for a LogRhythm deployment. The Platform Manager can include an embedded AI Engine instance, a Web Console, or both. The Platform Manager is a required component in the LogRhythm solution, and each deployment has a single Platform Manager.
Data Processor (DP) Version 7 (Formerly Log Manager)
. The Data Processor provides high-performance, distributed, and highly available processing of machine and forensic data. Data Processors receive machine and forensic data from collectors and forensic sensors. The Data Processor archives data and distributes both the original copy and the structured copy to other LogRhythm components for indexing, machine-based analytics, and alarming.
Data Indexer (DX) Version 7 (Formerly Log Manager)
. The Data Indexer provides high-performance, distributed, and highly scalable indexing and searching of machine and forensic data. Data Indexers store both the original and structured copies of data to enable search-based analytics.
In LogRhythm 7.1.4, the communication between the Data Processor and Data Indexer was improved, resulting in increased resiliency to data spikes and reliability of message delivery. These changes impact least privilege, as extra services were created and ports were changed.
System Monitor Agents
. LogRhythm System Monitor Agents are deployed on systems that require forensic monitoring, or to read logs from target systems in a scalable fashion. Agents are more difficult to lock down, as the privilege footprint can vary depending on which endpoint areas are being monitored and how the Agent is configured to collect data.
LogRhythm Users
. Users who access the LogRhythm SIEM are already configured to have minimal privileges on any LogRhythm-related system. These users are also already linked to LogRhythm-generated security roles in the LogRhythm data stores.

When evaluating least privilege, it often helps to understand the security zones or trust boundaries from a system perspective. For the LogRhythm SIEM, boundaries can vary by deployment footprint, but can be generalized.
Depending on the exact deployment footprint, the zones can collapse onto a single server (including the Agent), or be distributed across many servers, networks, and endpoint devices. In a large deployment, multiple appliances may be used, and certain data stores (for example, Report Archives or Inactive Log Archives) may be offloaded to separate storage systems not shown in Figure 1.
In terms of securing permissions, user privilege must be considered both within a zone and between zones. If permission is required to leave a security zone, then the privilege must be considered a higher threat, as it may enable the expansion of an attack if a malicious user has compromised a particular account.

Services deployed on a Platform Manager, Data Processor, or Data Indexer (or colocated on an XM) are considered to be inside a LogRhythm-specific security zone. This zone is usually a set of one or more appliance devices provided by LogRhythm. Agents can be deployed on a wide variety of systems outside the XM zone, and, depending on the network topography, may be in multiple, differing security contexts. Based on feature usage and deployment pattern, some LogRhythm services may require access to remote hosts or other systems that have no LogRhythm software installed.
1 Applies only if function is offloaded from DP/PM/LM/EM environment
2 Applies only if enabled

Each user context requires access to certain resources. To run in a Least-Privileged mode, each context should be locked down to only allow access to named resources. This section provides an overview of the types of resources required by LogRhythm services.

Various LogRhythm components read and/or write to file locations or UNC paths on local machines, and, in some cases, to remote machines or remote file shares. In certain cases (for example, SmartResponse), the component may even need to execute scripts or software stored in the file share. Shared resource permissions are defined as a combination of the explicit file path and six standard permissions for Windows folders:
Read
. Grants permission to list the contents of the directory and read the contents of any files in the directory.
Write
. Grants permission to add files to the directory and write to files.
Read and Execute
. Grants permission to read and execute files in the directory. Note that, depending on the nature of the executable files, this may cause privilege escalation.
Modify
. Grants permission to modify the folder structure by creating, renaming, or removing subfolders.
Full Control
. Grants the account full control (all permissions) over the resource.
Children Inherit
. Determines that child folders should inherit the permissions of the parent.
Almost every LogRhythm service that requires shared resource access has a configurable path for the resource. By default, the resources are placed in a local installation directory. You can change the locations using either the service-specific configuration tool or the Advanced Properties options in the Console’s Deployment Manager.

For LogRhythm components that require local or remote Windows Registry access, the permissions are defined by the registry key name and the 11 different standard Windows Registry permissions:
Read Control
. Grants permission to read the DACL (Discretionary Access Control List), which is generally required to identify which users have permissions.
Write Owner
. Grants permission to modify the container’s owner.
Write DAC
. Grants permission to change the permissions on the DACL. Delete – Grants permission to delete a key.
Create Link
. Generally not applicable; reserved by the operating system.
Notify
. Grants permission to request change notifications for registry keys or subkeys.
Enumerate SubKeys
. Grants permission to iterate through any subkeys.
Set Value
. Grants permission to set a value on the current object.
Query Value
. Grants permission to query a value on the current object.
Full Control
. Grants full control (all permissions) over registry key.
Children Inherit
. Determines that child keys should inherit the permissions.
If you are not familiar with setting advanced registry permissions, you can reach the settings by performing the following actions:
Start Registry Editor (note: Admin permissions are required to make changes).
Find the target key.
Right-click the key, and then click
Permissions
.
In the Permissions dialog box, click
Advanced
.
In the Advanced Security Settings panel, click the
Effective Permissions
tab.

LogRhythm accounts only access the LogRhythm databases (EMDB, Data Indexer, etc.). By default, all database access is controlled through database accounts created during the installation and configuration of the LogRhythm software. Each account is tied to a database role that is defined in the setup scripts.
All LogRhythm database access requires the default SQL Server port 1433.
It is imperative to change all default passwords on initial deployment.

LogRhythm services communicate with each other through a combination of reading/writing database values, and also through encrypted communication via network ports. If per-user, port-level security is required, permissions can be defined for each account based on the types and targets of communication and the default port numbers.

In certain cases, LogRhythm services may require elevated or extra permissions to access other resources such as third-party applications or specific system services. These requirements are noted as “Other Resources.”
For example, Agents can be configured to perform remote event log collection. This access may require creating accounts or adjusting privileges on the third-party system and linking the Agent security context to those accounts.

LogRhythm runs on software and systems provided by third parties, including Microsoft, Oracle, and others. Each of these systems may have additional privilege or requirements not explicitly discussed in this document.
Of special note, all Windows-based services require access to the .NET Framework. However, none of the services use custom assemblies stored in the GAC.

As with all security policies, choosing the right balance of risk, functionality, and complexity depends heavily on the risk tolerance and standard policies of your company or agency. The approaches listed here are recommendations only, and they may or may not be appropriate given your particular policies, risk tolerance, deployment architecture, and IT staff levels

As a general rule, if a function is not absolutely required, consider configuring all systems to block that function. With this in mind, the first step of any least-privilege setup is to determine which features are required to meet your business requirements. With regard to LogRhythm, the main questions will include:
Core Services
Do you need core services configured for high availability or disaster recovery?
Do you offload log storage, reports, or any other state information from the application servers?
Do you require a file-based notification system?
Do you leverage SmartResponse? If so, do you execute from the Platform Manager or through the System Monitors?
Data Processors
Do you require offloaded archives?
Does your Data Processor provide Log Distribution Services (LDS)?
Agents
Which log sources will each Agent collect from?
Will any Agent collect logs from remote sources?

As shown in Table 3, all LogRhythm components except for Agents can be deployed in an isolated security zone. The default appliance-based deployment uses local system accounts for this reason, as none of the services require access to non-LogRhythm equipment.
Agents can be deployed under a user context that is as restrictive as possible based on the type of information collected. See the Agent section for your specific operating system details.

If your environment requires the use of service accounts managed by Active Directory, best practice is to lock down the permissions for each service according to the guidance provided later in this document.

The *nix-based systems require different permissions because of the underlying operating system. By default, the *nix Agents are deployed to run under root because of the requirement to access port 514 to gather Syslog data.
To run a *nix Agent with non-root privileges, see the current instructions in the LogRhythm SIEM Help.

"This section provides information about some of the security features in LogRhythm, including passwords and password encryption, support for Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), users and security roles, and user security permissions.

All login activity and services run by any user on the Client Console are secured by OAuth2. Services include searches performed with the following:
Tail
Investigation
Personal Dashboard
TopX
Reports (when run as Investigations)
SecondLook
To audit secure message transport search, you can review Console.log. You can find Console.log in the following location: %APPDATA%\LogRhythm\logs.

All passwords stored in configuration flat files, such as .ini files, or SQL Server database tables, such as SMTP server password in the EMDB.ARM table, are encrypted. All password entries in the Client Console are masked.
LogRhythm supports passwords up to 255 characters long for SIEM services and the Client Console.
Encryption Method:
Generated key (64 bytes) is hashed (SHA1) into 20-byte array (256 bits)
AES encryption: cipher mode is ECB and padding mode is PKCS7
Where passwords are stored and entered in a LogRhythm deployment:
Configuration (.ini) files (scmedsvr, scarm, lrjobmgr, LRAIEEngine, sdee)
Database Tables
EMDB System Monitor
EMDB ARM
EMDB System Monitor
EMDB ARM
Client Console

The LogRhythm Encryption Utility does the following:
Encrypts passwords and writes output to the Client Console.
Encrypts Cisco IPS, Qualys, Nessus, NeXpose, Metasploit, Sourcefire, Retina, and eStreamer passwords used by the LogRhythm System Monitor for event and vulnerability collection. Encrypted passwords will be written to the value of the ""Password="" parameter in the specified configuration (.ini) file — the configuration file must already exist.
The lrcrypt.exe file is located in one of the following locations: C:\Program Files\LogRhythm\LogRhythm System Monitor\lrcrypt.exeC:\Program Files (x86)\LogRhythm\LogRhythm System Monitor\lrcrypt.exe
Usage: lrcrypt [-e passwordtoencrypt] [path\inifile]
For example, if the user runs lrcrypt -e password config\nessus.ini, the value specified by password is encrypted and written as the value for the Password parameter in the nessus.ini file.

To get encrypted values for other configuration file parameters — those other than Password — you must run lrcrypt without specifying the path to the .ini file.
For example: C:\Program Files\LogRhythm\LogRhythm System Monitor>lrcrypt -e mypassword
LogRhythm Password Encryption Utility
Encrypted password: 3||//y/XnKOyOls8HGOb6WaBw==
In this case, mark and copy the encrypted password value and manually paste it into the configuration file.
For security reasons, you should ensure that strong passwords are used and that all passwords are protected.

A LogRhythm user is created within LogRhythm as a person record and user account. A person record doesn’t require a user account, but a user account requires a person record. A user account is also required to log in to the system. By default, a LogRhythm Administrator and LogRhythm Analyst user is created and available with a new LogRhythm Deployment. Each LogRhythm user is granted database access under a specific security role.
LogRhythm users access the LogRhythm solution via the LogRhythm Client Console by entering a user ID and password. As part of the login, all communications can be encrypted by selecting the Encrypt all communications check box from the Login window. Users can log in with a Windows Account or a specific user account. In either case, the record must exist as a person/user within the LogRhythm solution as created via the Client Console. If FIPS is enabled in the local security policy, Windows Authentication is required and therefore is the only method to log in to the Client Console.
Each LogRhythm user account must be assigned a User Profile. A User Profile is assigned one of the following Security Roles: Global Administrator, Restricted Administrator, Global Analyst, Restricted Analyst, or SOAP API Service Administrator.
The general permissions for each Security Role are described below.

Automatic Log Source Configuration leverages the existing SNMP management infrastructure to specifically identify devices on the network. This functionality includes identification for the following virtual sources:
Syslog (TCP/UDP)
Cisco NetFlow
IPFIX
Juniper J-Flow
sFlow
SNMP Traps
LogRhythm has many devices identified. However, if you have a device that was not automatically configured or you don’t see a device you would like configured in the Advanced Criteria Manager; you can send this information to
LogRhythm Support
to be added to LogRhythm’s list of devices.

Log Source Virtualization is supported on Windows agents and on Linux agents
from System Monitor 7.5.1.8001 and later.
Log Source Virtualization makes it possible to consume all the available intelligence within individual log source files that contain multiple records from different sources. When virtualization is enabled on a log source, it is referred to as a “parent” log source, and the different records inside it are referred to as either “virtual” or “child” log sources (when referencing log sources, the terms “virtual” and “child” are often used interchangeably).
Virtual log sources are treated in the same way as other log sources. They are processed in accordance with their assigned MPE policies and they appear in the same lists as the other log sources within the deployment. In contrast to Syslog Virtualization, which applies only to syslog relay logs received by the System Monitor syslog server, Log Source Virtualization can be applied to syslog relay sources, Windows Event Logs, flat files, and any other log source within your deployment that contains multiple records.
To begin Log Source Virtualization, you need to apply properly configured Log Source Virtualization templates to the parent log sources at the agent level. Virtualization templates contain one or more virtual log sources that include identifier regular expressions (also called “regexes”) to run against and parse data in the parent sources. When one of the records matches a particular regex, a child log is created and assigned to the virtual log source associated with that regex. Records that do not match any of the regexes are assigned to the Catch-All log source.
Virtual log sources cannot be edited to the same extent as their non-virtual counterparts because certain properties (including their lifecycle) remain tied to their parent sources. For example, if a parent log source is retired or has its virtualization disabled, all of its child log sources are retired or disabled as well. You can, however, edit the name, regex, MPE policy, and log source type properties for virtual log sources.
You can add, modify, and delete both virtual log sources and virtualization templates from the Log Source Virtualization Template Manager. As you create or modify templates and virtual log sources, you can check their regex parsing and distribution accuracy by pasting sample logs into the testing tool. Keep in mind that changes you make to the properties of either virtual log sources or virtualization templates only affect the future child log sources created by them (existing child sources are unaffected).

Load balanced virtual log sources let you specify the log sources that are being sent to a load balancer and the System Monitors to which the load balancer is sending log messages. These options enable deployments with larger volumes to utilize load balanced log sources without data loss.
In LogRhythm, you can designate one or more System Monitors and one or more Log Sources as ""load balancing."" After doing this, all load balancing System Monitors must be made aware of all load balanced Log Sources, regardless of where the Log Sources originated. As more System Monitors or Log Sources are created, the updated configuration is pushed out to all load balancing System Monitors.
System Monitors are designated under the Syslog and Flow Settings tab of the System Monitor Agent Properties dialog box.
Log Sources are designated under the Additional Settings tab of the Log Message Source Properties dialog box or the Log Source Settings dialog box (when adding in batch).

New Log Sources are saved in a separate Acceptance table (the New Log Sources grid) pending a direct action on the part of the user. This includes the following log source types:
Syslog (TCP/UDP)
Cisco NetFlow
IPFIX
Juniper J-Flow
sFlow
SNMP Traps
Additionally, two configurable identification process, Automatic Log Source Configuration and Log Source Preregistration, are available to allow LogRhythm to identify the source for you.
On the Log Sources tab, the New/Pending Log Sources can be viewed in the New Log Sources upper grid. The lower grid includes the active Log Sources that have already been accepted.
In the New Log Source tab, the following columns appear:
Incomplete
. The new log source has not been identified by the system yet. The user can act on the record now, or wait for the system to finish identifying it. When finished, the record status will be changed to Pending; however, the user will have to manually refresh the list to see the latest values from the database.
Pending
. The new log source is waiting for the user to accept or reject it.
Rejected
. The user has rejected the new log source. You should disable transmission of logs from the sending device prior to deleting the acceptance record or another pending log source will be generated.
The computer or device name that was either parsed out of the log message or determined by the message origin. May be blank.
Hostnames with a space are not supported by LogRhythm software.
This lets the user know if a new host record will be created for this log source or it will use an existing host record. Must be resolved via the context menu.
If the host has never been resolved, the resolved known host column will display blank values. When the user Resolves Known Host, the value will be populated.
If a matching host is found, it appears.
If matching host is not found, then the New Host – [entity]:[hostname] appears.

"
In deployments where the number of new Log Sources is high, administrators can configure various levels of automatic Log Source acceptance, as follows:
Automatically Resolve Log Source Host
Automatically Identify the Log Source Type
Automatically Accept the Log Source (includes host resolution and identification of Log Source type)
You can create one or more rules to be used to evaluate incoming Log Sources. Acceptance can be based on the IP address of a new Log Source, or on regular expression pattern matching. You can have multiple rules enabled, and you can use the Log Source Acceptance Rule Manager to enable or disable rules, or change the priority of rules.

When the Target Entity is specified for an automatic log source acceptance rule, it is important to ensure the log source search scope is set appropriately for the System Monitor that initiates the auto-acceptance. The log source is processed as follows:
If the Target Entity is in the System Monitor's search scope, the log source and host are created in the Target Entity.
If the Target Entity is not in the System Monitor’s search scope, the log source goes into
the acceptance table
where it can be manually accepted.  An ERROR log is written to the scmedsvr.log file indicating what the scope problem is and how to remedy it.
If the System Monitor’s search scope is set to
System Monitor
, an ERROR log is written to the scmedsvr.log file indicating what the scope problem is and how to remedy it. The
System Monitor
search scope only provides access to the log sources that System Monitor owns. Therefore, it cannot verify that there is no other host or log source with that IP address, so the auto-acceptance is rejected to prevent creating duplicates in the Target Entity.
For information on changing the search scope of a System Monitor, see
Set the Log Source Identification Search Scope

"Application records define an application and its ports and protocols so that MPE rules can identify a log origin. For example, if TCP port 53 is mapped to the DNS application, then rules that identify traffic on TCP port 53 can associate it correctly with DNS. Rules can also be set to associate all logs that match a particular application record automatically, regardless of port and protocol.
An association between an application and a port or protocol is global. There can only be one unique pairing for a single LogRhythm deployment.

"There are times when information within a log message needs to be transformed into a more useable format or masked to hide sensitive or regulated data. LogRhythm allows you to set up Data Masking Rules to transform, redact, or substitute text on a global or log message source basis.
Users must monitor the processing rates in their solution for a period of time to ensure their system can support the processing requirements.
Data Masking Rules allow you to perform multiple types of data transformation and masking. The Archives continue to contain the original raw log in its original collected state. The Data Indexer contains the transformed raw log and any associated transformed metadata.
The following are the types of data masking:

Transform specific text within a log message into a specified usable format where the input text is used to create the output text and the output can contain new characters and formatting.
For example, transform (3)www(9)microsoft(3)com(0) to www.microsoft.com.

Redact specific text within a log message where all or part of the input text is replaced with a specified masking character or string.
For example, redact a Social Security Number SSN: 123-45-6789 to SSN: XXX-XX-XXXX.

Substitute specific text within a log message into a consistent unique value. The value is hashed into a new unique value where the same input value always results in the same output value across different log messages.
For example, transform SSN: 123-45-6789 to SSN: bfda2b7_579e_b1dc_3cba_e0df31fa8ff0.

"Global Log Processing Rules (GLPR) are a part of the Advanced Data Management settings which provide a way to override settings defined in Classification Based Data Management (CBDM) or Standard Data Management modes (Log Message Source, Log Processing Policy). A GLPR provide a way to apply Data Management settings across all Data Processors, Log Sources and Log Processing Policies to logs that meet your specific criteria.
GLPR overrides are globally applied to log messages that match Classification Criteria (such as Network/Deny, Authentication/Failure, etc), and are customized with Include and/or Exclude Filters for log metadata. This flexibility provides a manageable way to determine how logs are processed throughout the system, regardless of settings used by various Log Sources and/or Log Processing Policies. Logs that do not match the GLPR filters are processed normally per CBDM or Standard Data Management settings.
LogRhythm diagnostic common events are not affected by Global Log Processing rules.

On the Rules tab toolbar, click the plus icon.
In the Rule Block Types pane, select and drag a rule block to the Rule Block Designer from one of the twelve possible types of rule blocks.
Rule Blocks
Description
LOG
Observed
A log message that met the user-defined parameters was observed.
It can be in any position in the rule.
Not Observed Compound
No log message that met the user-defined parameters was observed after a preceding rule block was satisfied.
It must follow another rule block and be the last block in the rule.
Not Observed Scheduled
No log message that met the user-defined parameters was observed when expected based on a defined schedule. It must be the only block in the rule.
This type of Log Rule Block cannot be enabled with Entity Segregation.
THRESHOLD
Observed
The defined threshold was reached across one or more log messages that met user-defined parameters. A threshold is quantitative such as number of bytes out. It can be in any position in the rule.
Not Observed Compound
The defined threshold was not reached across one or more log messages after a preceding rule block was satisfied. It must follow another rule block and be the last block in the rule.
Not Observed Scheduled
The defined threshold was not reached across one or more log messages based on a defined schedule. It must be the only block in the rule.
This type of Threshold Rule Block cannot be enabled with Entity Segregation.
UNIQUE VALUES
Observed
Unique values were observed for a specified metadata field across two or more log messages having specific characteristics. Examples of unique values: 10 unique logins or 10 unique hosts. It can be in any position in the rule.
Not Observed Compound
Unique values were not observed for a specified metadata field across two or more log messages after a preceding rule block was satisfied. Examples of unique values: 10 unique logins or 10 unique hosts. It must follow another rule block and be the last block in the rule.
Not Observed Scheduled
Unique values were not observed for a specified metadata field across two or more log messages based on a defined schedule. Examples of unique values: 10 unique logins or 10 unique hosts. It must be the only block in the rule.
This type of Unique Values Rule Block cannot be enabled with Entity Segregation.
BEHAVIORAL
Whitelist
Similar to a Log Observed block, except that it only triggers when the selected Grouped By values of the Log are not found in the associated whitelist of the Whitelist Profile block to which it is linked. (The linked Whitelist Profile block is created automatically and cannot be separately deleted or created.) In this case, a log is observed in a metadata field that is not in the associated whitelist.
A Whitelist Rule Block enables users to record almost any behavior from a source integrated with the LogRhythm Data Filters. By comparing current logs to historical behavior, a Whitelist can be used to send an alert when behavior from a user or a system changes.
Use Case
. Whitelisting processes on production servers – In this scenario, the user creates a rule that records all processes observed on production servers. The rule runs for a set amount of time called a learning period. After the learning period, any processes observed that are not on the whitelist trigger an alarm. The event triggering the alarm could be a web server that has been compromised launching a malicious process to allow attackers to gain shell access.
Statistical
During runtime of the AIE Engine, a particular set of statistics will be collected. These statistics are collected within the AIE Runtime object the statistic observed. At a regular interval, a routine will be executed to collect the data from the various runtime engine components and send the information to the database for persistence.
Use Case
. Look for an abnormal number of authentication failures. Statistical rules compare live data to live data. If I know that the number of successful logins to unsuccessful logins in a 10 to 1 ratio, I can create a statistical rule that looks for the ratio of successes to failures to drop below 10 to 1. For example, if the amount of unsuccessful logins increases to a 12 to 2 ratio, an alarm is triggered.
Multiple expression can be written into the rule to reflect a range, for example, there must be between 5 and 10 times as many successful logins. Also floors can be implemented, such as the ratio must be greater than a 10 to 1 ratio and there must be at least 100 successful logins so a very low log rate won’t cause false positives. This also lets you compare static data fields within the same window. You can compare the origin user to the impacted user to make sure they are different in an account modification log if your environment does not allow people to modify their own accounts.
Trend
The AIE Trending Rule Block provides for automatic base-lining of log and flow data against which various trends can be established. These trends can then be evaluated against current log and flow data to determine if a deviation has occurred. Deviations in a trend might be an indication of a security, compliance, or operations issue. In this case, a set of criteria is met comparing current log messages with recent log messages.
The Trend Rule block compares prerecorded data to live data in an attempt to identify anomalies in behavior. Unlike other rule blocks, the Trend Rule block is able to add additional data to the baseline to accommodate changes in behavior over a period of time. Comparing a baseline that is able to change over time to live data enables the Trend Rule Block to look for anomalies in behavior while accommodating normal changes in the organization.
Use Case
. Look for increased traffic on the network. You can build a baseline, over a week, measuring the amount of traffic your network receives through its ports. If the traffic increases by a predetermined percentage, an alarm is triggered. This is also how rogue host detection is implemented. In this case, the MAC addresses seen on the network are recorded over a 30 day period. When a MAC address is observed that does not exist in the baseline, this means a new host is on the network. This causes an alarm to trigger.

Quantitative filters are available from these LogRhythm tools and utilities:
Alarm Rules
GLPR wizard
Investigator
Log Distribution Services (LDS )
Personal Dashboard filters
Reports
SecondLook
Tail
Quantitative fields include:
Amount
Bytes Sent and Bytes Rcvd
Duration
Packets Sent and Packets Rcvd
Quantity
Rate
Size
The operators for quantitative filters are described in the following table.

LogRhythm can use wildcards and pattern matching in search string filters to increase flexibility and efficiency. For example:
Use wildcards to search for a particular sender or recipient email address in the Platform Manager, Data Processor, or LogMart by specifying only some of the characters in the address.
Filter to find any matches for senders at a given domain name.
Filter to find a specific host name.

On the Actions tab of the Filter Editor, you assign Actions (SmartResponses) to Alarms. More than one Action can be assigned to a single Alarm. The Actions can be configured to run in a specified order or all at the same time. Actions can also be required to have approval before being executed.
The Actions tab consists of the following sections:
Action
. Manage the actions to be executed and how they are executed.
Run Actions
. Set the order in which actions are executed.
Set Action
. Select one of the available actions from all active SmartResponse plugins.
Parameters
. Define the command line parameters that pass constant values or data fields to the executable.
Approvals
. Manage approvals required before the action is executed.
Execute SmartResponse Action from
. Specify the component from which the SmartResponse action should be executed.
Save Action
. Save the action to add it to the Action list.

The sections below explain all the actions associated with a rule or alarm. You can add more than one action to the list, delete actions, reorder actions, and specify whether actions should run at the same time or in the order listed.
For AI Engine rules, SmartResponse actions do not work if the Alarm on event occurrence check box is not selected on the
Settings tab
.

Click

On the Set Action menu, select an action.
In the
Parameters
section, configure all the required parameters for the action.
(Optional)
In the
Approvals
section, add approvals for the action.
In the

In the Action grid, select one or more actions.
Click
Delete
, and then click
Yes
when prompted to confirm the deletion.
The selected actions are removed from the list.

In the Action grid, select an action.
Click the up or down arrow to move the action.

When at least two actions are configured in the Action list, you can specify how the actions should run using the Run Actions option.
In the Run Actions section, do one of the following:
Select
At the Same Time
if you want all actions to run at the same time.
If any action requires approval, an approval notification will be sent, and the action remains in a state of pending execution until all of its approval requirements have been met.
Select
In the order listed
if you want the actions to run one after the other, in the order listed from top to bottom.
Each action waits for its predecessor action to complete before it is initiated. If an action requires approval, an approval notification is sent, and the Action remains in a state of pending execution until all of its approval requirements have been met. Subsequent actions will not run until the action needing approval has completed.
An action in a sequenced response executes regardless of whether the action before it fails or succeeds.
Select

To configure any of the available SmartResponse actions, select an action from the Set Action menu. The Set Action menu only displays actions available in SmartResponse Plugins that have been loaded in the SmartResponse Plugin Manager.

The Parameters grid displays the selected action's script and all the command line parameters that can be passed to the action. The Script row is fixed and cannot be modified. All other rows can be modified.
For each configurable parameter, do the following:
Chose one of the following for the Type column. Your choice determines the options available for the Value column:
Constant Value
. Requires a manual entry in the Value column, to be used when running the script. Requires user input.
Alarm Field
. Requires a specific metadata field be selected in the Value column. Does not require user input but you can change which field is selected.
Constant Value
. Requires a manual entry in the Value column, to be used when running the script. Requires user input.
Alarm Field
. Requires a specific metadata field be selected in the Value column. Does not require user input but you can change which field is selected.
For fields whose type is Encrypted Value, you need to enter a value in the Value column. The value is masked as it is typed.
Configure the Values fields as needed.
(Optional)
For time-based metadata fields, specify a time zone and format to use in the Time Zone and Time Format columns.

The Approvals section allows you to select individuals or groups who must approve the selected action before it is executed.

The Settings tab allows you to configure common event properties, alarm properties, and general properties for the AI Engine Rule or Alarm Rule. It also enables you to set a suppression period for alarms. During the suppression period, additional logs or events that match the exact criteria of the suppressed alarm do create new events or alarms. Suppression looks at all the Group By fields in an AI Engine rule. All fields must match for the suppression to work. For example, if you have a rule configured to detect three failed logins from a single source to a single destination, after the first alarm, any matching logs with that source and destination combo are ignored. However, if that source fails three logins to a different destination, the alarm fires again and the suppression period for that combination begins.
The following table describes the settings you can configure on the Settings tab of the AI Engine Wizard.
Select the
Enable Suppression
check box to limit the number of events created by a rule so only the first occurrence of a qualifying event is created during the Suppression Period.
If you select the Enable Suppression check box, the Suppression Multiple field is enabled. The value you enter here is used in the formula:
Suppression Multiple * Suppression Interval = Suppression Period
The Suppression Interval value reflects the rule definition and the time limits set on the Thresholds and Unique Values tabs and in the AI Engine Rule Block Relationship.
When you tab off the Suppression Multiple field, the Suppression Period is recalculated.
Select to create an alarm when this event occurs and to enable the alarm status.
This box must be selected for notifications and SmartResponse actions to work.
If Alarm on event occurrence is selected, you can automatically drill down and cache results for this rule.
If the AIE Drill Down Cache is disabled in the LogRhythm Configuration Manager, automatic drilldown does not work, even if this check box is selected. For more information, see the
LogRhythm Software Installation Guide
.
The False Positive Probability is used in Risk-Based Priority (RBP) calculation for AI Engine Rules. It estimates how likely the rule is to generate a false positive response. A value of low indicates the pattern the rule matches is almost always a true positive. However, a value of high indicates the pattern the rule matches is very likely to be a false positive.
Options range from 0 to 9 with:
0 indicating the pattern the rule matched is almost always a true positive to
9 indicating the pattern the rule matched is very likely to be a false positive
The default = 5 - Medium-Medium.
The Environmental Dependence Factor is used in Risk-Based Priority (RBP) Calculation for AI Engine Rules. It determines how much additional configuration is required for the rule to function as expected within different network environments.
The options are:
None
. Default, no additional configuration required.
Low
. Minimum additional configuration required.
Medium
. Additional configuration required.
High
. Significant additional configuration required
Rule sets are used to divide rules among multiple AI Engine Servers. Minimum = 0, maximum = 100. 0 Appears as
None
in the Rule Manager grid.
Under heavy load, the AI Engine Server may need to suspend the lowest priority rules first.
Values = Low, Normal, or High.
If the AI Engine begins to run out of memory or fall behind, it automatically suspends rules starting with the lowest runtime priority.

None
.
Log Source Entity
. Segregates within the specific Entity of every log.
Log Source Root Entity
Segregates within the Root Entity of every log.
Data Segregation enables a single logical rule definition to be automatically applied at the Entity or Root Entity level to distinct groups of Log Sources within a deployment. Each Event is then guaranteed to only have considered Logs within the scope of the chosen Entity grouping.
Data segregation by entity also ensures that alarm notification emails sent by the Notification Service are only sent to recipients who have access to that entity. For the Notification Service to work, the AIE Drill Down Cache must be enabled in the LogRhythm Configuration Manager. Both the AIE Drill Down Cache API and the Notification Service settings can be modified in the Configuration Manager.

"SmartResponse lets you execute preventative actions when threatening activity is observed. Actions may provide deeper forensic or operational data, automate operations tasks, or implement security controls in defense of an attack or intrusion, such as disabling a compromised user account or terminating a connection between attacker and target. Based on the change management controls of an organization, SmartResponse actions can be executed immediately or after a quorum-based approval process.
SmartResponse is managed in the Client Console and processed through the Advanced Intelligence (AI) Engine and the Platform Manager's Alarming and Response Manager (ARM).
Some examples of SmartResponse use cases are listed below:
After an alarm is generated from a compromised system, a SmartResponse can initiate a vulnerability scan or packet capture on the target host.
After observing near concurrent successful logins using the same account from two different countries, a SmartResponse can disable the account.
After a critical operations issue is observed on a network device, a SmartResponse can automatically set the device to debug-level logging.
When an inappropriate process is detected on a server, such as BitTorrent or a Peer2Peer application, a SmartResponse can kill the process.
You can enable SmartResponse in LogRhythm by importing SmartResponse plugins. Plugins are self-contained binary files (*.lpi) containing one or more actions. Actions can leverage custom or commercial programs and scripts, and they can be executed when an assigned Alarm Rule or AI Engine Rule is triggered.
LogRhythm provides plugins that contain the most commonly requested actions. For all currently available SmartResponse Plugins, see
Download SmartResponse Shareables
. Users can develop their own SmartResponse plugins for custom needs. For information on how to develop them, see the
Develop SmartResponse Plugins
.
Creating a SmartResponse plugin is an advanced procedure. You must be familiar with XML and with writing executable scripts. For help creating a SmartResponse plugin, please contact your Customer Relationship Manager (CRM) or Professional Services Engineer.

LogRhythm supports a quorum-based approval process where up to three levels of approval can be required before an action is executed. Individuals or groups can be assigned to each level. When multiple individuals are assigned to the same level, only one needs to provide approval. If any individual rejects the action, the action is immediately aborted prior to execution.
You should carefully consider SmartResponse approvals when more than one SmartResponse is assigned to an Alarm or AI Engine Rule. If an action requires approval, no subsequent actions can be executed until approval is granted.

Manage plugins with the SmartResponse Plugin Manager.
Configure plugin actions in an AI Engine Rule or Alarm Rule actions.
If AI Engine Rule actions or Alarm Rule actions require approval, one of the following must be completed:
Approval of the Action
Denial of the Action

The SmartResponse Plugin Manager window has four options within the menu bar. From left to right they include:
Refresh
. Refreshes the grid.
Actions
. Provides a menu to Activate, Retire, Import, or Export SmartResponse Plugins.
Create Plugin
. Opens the Create SmartResponse Plugin window to browse to the location of an existing configuration file and its executables to create the SmartResponse Plugin.
Properties
. Allows you to set Execution Access permissions. In order for users to view and run SmartResponse actions from the Web Console, their user profile must correspond to the Execution Access permission set here. The default Write Access permission is Public Global Administrator and the default entity is Global Entity. These are not configurable settings. To prevent all ad hoc execution of a SmartResponse from the Web Console, select the
Disable ad hoc execution
check box.
The SmartResponse Plugin Manager contains two grids. The top grid lists all plugins. If no plugins have been imported, both grids are empty.
The top grid displays the following details for each plugin:
The SmartResponse Plugin Manager context menu, access by right-clicking the top grid, allows the user to select and clear plugin records, clear filters, take actions, set properties, and toggle the view of retired plugins.
The bottom grid lists the available actions for each of the selected plugins and the number of parameters taken by the action.
You can download SmartResponse plugins by going to the
LogRhythm Community
and clicking on the
Shareables
link on menu at the top of the page. The filters allow you to choose from supported and unsupported plugins, as well as ones created by LogRhythm or by other users.

Creating a SmartResponse plugin is an advanced procedure. You must be familiar with XML and with writing executable scripts. For help creating a SmartResponse plugin, please contact your Customer Relationship Manager (CRM) or Professional Services Engineer.
LogRhythm’s SmartResponse® Plugin (SRP) framework delivers an extensible mechanism for responding to security and operational incidents. An analyst can execute SmartResponse Plugins manually, or the SIEM can execute them automatically based on a particular alarm. Depending on configuration, the action can be executed under the context of the Platform Manager (via the Alarm and Response Manager (ARM) service), or remotely under the context of a specific System Monitor.
SmartResponse plugins are used in Security Orchestration Automation and Response (SOAR) in the following distinct ways:
Context enrichment
. SRPs can be launched directly from the web console in the Analyzer grid. Generally, SRPs used in this fashion are designed to provide additional context on an alarm or log message. The SRP's primary function is to gather some external data that adds additional context to the source object. Typical examples include running an IP address through a reputation service like VirusTotal.
Remediation
. SRPs were originally designed for remediation of threats. Therefore, there are references to remediation actions throughout the configuration. A SRP focused on remediation has a primary function of completing an action to change the environment. For example, an SRP that integrates with a Firewall vendor might change the Firewall settings as a result of an alarm from a threat feed, or in response to a ransomware attack.
Both types of SmartResponse Plugins follow the same development and packaging process. The only difference is that a context SRP will typically write out information to standard out, whereas a remediation plugin may not write out any messages at all.
This guide is divided into the following sections to help you learn how to develop and deploy custom SmartResponse Plugins:

"Although a SmartResponse can call any executable program, Windows PowerShell is the most common type of payload. PowerShell offers an incredible range of scriptable capabilities and is installed by default on most systems that have either a LogRhythm Platform Manager or a LogRhythm Windows System Monitor. If your targeted action is not installed by default on the execution system, you will have to install it so that the SmartResponse Plugin can execute.
The PowerShell payload must be designed in a way that it:
Accepts command line arguments.
Performs proper error handling.
Executes an action.
(Optional)
Writes any output to standard out.
To use the SmartResponse as part of a context operation, write any messages to standard out (typically using Write-Host in PowerShell). When the SmartResponse Plugin is executed from the Web Console, the output from standard out maps to a display window so that an analyst can review and act on the information.

SmartResponse Plugins can run on the LogRhythm Platform Manager (W2K8R2 or W2K12) or on a v7.0 or higher LogRhythm System Monitor running on Windows XP.
While administrators can use any executable file for a SmartResponse action, PowerShell is the most commonly used scripting language for SmartResponse. Since Microsoft has included it with all versions of Windows since Windows 2008, and it can be installed on all versions since and including Windows XP, it is one of the most widely available scripting platforms within the Microsoft Windows ecosystem. The minimum supported version of PowerShell is v2. If the plugin requires a newer version then this is included in the documentation accompanying the plugin, or as a validation step in the PowerShell Script itself.
PowerShell best practices specific to SmartResponse Plugin scripts are listed below. General guidelines and best practices for PowerShell are beyond the scope of this document.

As a best practice, provide useful comments in the PowerShell script. The comments should give a description of what the script is intended to accomplish, note any limitations, and provide explanations of specific logic. LogRhythm recommends specific comments for SmartResponse Plugins that describe which LogRhythm data should be supplied and whether the script runs on the Platform Manager or a System Monitor.
The following is an example of the header comments listing what LogRhythm components can execute the script:

PowerShell offers a number of ways for scripts to consume command-line parameters. The most important thing is that the script consumes them in a robust manner, since the plugin containing the PowerShell is run silently by the ARM or System Monitor process. Note that the PowerShell execution policy should be set to All-Signed before executing any SRP.
The following example shows the preferred method for consuming command-line parameters. This provides clear feedback to the LogRhythm or Web Console if an invalid parameter is passed, supports both positional and named parameters, and allows parameters to be mandatory or optional.
Using CmdletBinding() provides Verbose and Debug options. The binding command and parameter definitions must be the first executable lines in the script (including before the exception handling), otherwise the script will not work.
In this example, two parameters are passed to the script. The first is mandatory, and is defined as being in position 1. This parameter may be passed without specifying its name by placing it in position 1 at the command prompt, since the position is defined. Alternatively, the parameter name may be specified. The second parameter is also mandatory, but no positional value is given, so this parameter must be passed as a named parameter at the command prompt.
The SmartResponse Plugin configuration file supports using positional or named parameters. Positional parameters are defined by the Order field, whereas named parameters are defined by the Switch field. A trailing space must be included within the quotations marks:
For clarity, each SmartResponse should use either all positional or all named parameters, and not a combination of the two to avoid confusion.

Using the CmdLetBinding() approach to parameters provides Verbose and Debug logging methods. Any PowerShell script using CmdLetBinding() may be called using a -verbose or -debug switch. There is no need to provide any parameters or code handling for this switch.
If -verbose is used as a command-line parameter, it activates any Write-Verbose commands in the script. Output is written to the command prompt in yellow text with the prefix of ""VERBOSE:"".
If -debug is used as a command-line parameter, it activates any Write-Debug commands in the script. Output is written to the command prompt in red text with the prefix of ""DEBUG:"".
This has the effect of allowing Write-Debug and Write-Verbose statements to be placed inline in the code for the purposes of debugging or troubleshooting, but those statements will automatically be ignored if the appropriate switch is not specified on the command line.
It is sufficient for most SmartResponse plugins using PowerShell script to implement either Verbose or Debug. It is unnecessary to implement both.

PowerShell offers a variety of ways to handle errors and exceptions in scripts. Errors and exceptions may be included at a variety of levels, and the mechanisms provided can be nested so that different exceptions and errors are handled in different ways.
Write-Error and Write-Host are typically used to report errors in the PowerShell script. The SmartResponse framework captures standard and error output and writes it to the agent log. Additionally, the output is sent back to the SmartResponse interface to be displayed in the output field.
It is recommended to include a high-level exception handling routine for the whole script. The following example provides some guidance:
This locates any terminating exceptions and exits the script with an error code.
Implement more focused error handling for specific scenarios using the try/catch/finally construct. For example:

Permission to execute PowerShell scripts is governed by an Execution Policy. The PowerShell ExecutionPolicy setting allows restricting from where and what types of scripts can be executed. By default, Windows only allows interactive shell use.
The following are the possible states of an ExecutionPolicy:
Restricted
Unrestricted
AllSigned
RemoteSigned
Bypass
In addition to the ExecutionPolicy, there are a number of different scopes for the ExecutionPolicy:CurrentUser, Machine or Process. For more information, see
About Execution Policies
on Microsoft’s Website.
LogRhythm recommends the following for all customers:
Set the ExecutionPolicy on hosts that run SmartResponse to AllSigned for the scope of the service account running the SmartResponse.
Digitally sign PowerShell Scripts developed for use in SmartResponse with a trusted code signing certificate before the plugin is created for final release.
The ExecutionPolicy may already be defined via GPO or otherwise.

The following sample PowerShell script follows the pattern of most SmartResponse payloads. The error handling and argument parsing are standard. Variability between different SmartResponse Plugins comes from what functions are executed after parsing the arguments.
This script has been reduced to the most simplified format for readability, and does not conform to all best practices.





To simplify testing and evaluation of your code, LogRhythm recommends writing one script per action and keeping the function logic as simple as possible. Avoid using switch logic to make a single script perform multiple actions based on an input argument. It is often better to make multiple actions to keep the logic cleaner, and make the code more testable and re-usable.
The sample payload consists of a single action. Execute the payload by typing the following in a command line prompt:

Based on the payload, you next create a SmartResponse configuration file called actions.xml. This file defines actions taken by the plugin and provides a mechanism for passing arguments to the plugin.

The XML wrapper consists of a mandatory header and one or more action blocks. The header names the SmartResponse and assigns it a unique identifier (GUID). Each action section has two basic tasks. First, to define the functions performed by the SmartResponse. Second, to map input fields from the SIEM into command line arguments for the action. A simple version of this file completes the following:
Defines a single action.
Requires ""-file AddItemToList.ps1"" as the first command line argument.
Provides the filename as the second command line argument.
Provides the item to add as the third command line argument.
The last two are string values that need to be dynamically set at runtime. Each time you run the SmartResponse, there is a chance you add a different item to a different list.
This full configuration file would appear follows:
The configuration file must be named actions.xml.
Note the following items in bold in the sample configuration file above:
The plugin is named Add Item To List.
The plugin contains one action, also called Add Item To List, that calls powershell.exe.
The first command line parameter is always -file AddItemToList.ps1.
The second command line parameter is a filename with no command line switch.
The third command line parameter is the item to add, with no command line switch.
The configuration file must model the expected parameters of the command line prompt execution of the payload. When you start writing the configuration file, refer to how you would expect to execute the response in the command line prompt.

In the previous section, we used a simple configuration wrapper with one action and simple parameters. In this section, we cover all of the optional elements in the wrapper and more complex configurations.

The configuration file is provided as an XML document which starts with an XML header (see the following example) and a schema reference defining the file as a plugin.
The initial tag consists of the following key attributes:
The XML namespace
. All of the SmartResponse wrapper syntax is defined in RemediationVersion1.xsd and all tags in the namespace start with ""remv1:.""
Name
. Every plugin must have a unique Name, as the name field is used to identify the script to the Plugin Manager.
GUID
. The Guid is an optional tag to uniquely identify the plugin in your SIEM environment. In the XML, you must use the exact capitalization of Guid, not GUID.
Version
. The optional Version tag manages multiple versions of the same plugin.
IsLogRhythmPlugin
. This optional tag is reserved for LogRhythm internal use. You must omit it or set it to false. If you set this attribute to true, you must also supply LogRyhthm’s license and sign the plugin (which cannot be done outside of LogRhythm).
Historically, few plugins have included the Guid, Version and IsLogRhythmPlugin attributes, and the XML can be created without these elements. The console generates a GUID for you if it is not included in the plugin.
The following shows the simplest possible XML header and closing tag. This wrapper has no actions and would be ineffective deployed in this way.
In version 7.2.2 and higher, the SmartResponse Plugin Manager requires the Guid, Version and IsLoGrhythmPlugin attributes in the XML. The minimal XML header is therefore:
If you upload a plugin with a duplicated GUID, you are prompted to replace the existing or create a new one for that plugin. The collision detection makes uploading a standard ""000"" GUID acceptable.
If present in the configuration file, the GUID and version display in the Console and are used as identifiers. If not, the plugin manager automatically generates both fields when the plugin is created.

A SmartResponse exists to perform actions. The Action section gives us a way to define what action to take, and what parameters to pass into the action from the Alarm.
The Action tag defines a name for the action and a command to execute. The tag may also contain additional xml parameter elements. For example, the following action tag defines an action to open PowerShell:
A plugin may define a single action, or it may define multiple actions. Therefore, there may be several Action elements within the configuration file, each representing an individual action related to the overall plugin purpose. For example, an NG Firewall may expose an API that offers multiple actions that may be initiated, and these actions may be delivered in a single SmartResponse Plugin. Placing multiple actions in a single plugin is simply an administrative convenience. Doing so has no effect on the eventual action of the plugin. Each action can exist in a standalone SmartResponse Plugin.
The name field provides a textual description of what the action does, and must be unique within the plugin. There is no requirement for it to be unique within the LogRhythm deployment. The action name may be the same as the plugin name. This is typically the case when a plugin only delivers one action. You can also have several named Actions contained within the plugin.
In the LogRhythm Console, the action displays as <plugin name>:<action name>. Long names may wrap or not display fully. The best practice is to keep the names as short as possible while maintaining descriptive clarity.
The Command attribute provides the fully qualified path and name of the application which executes to complete the action. This Command field can be any executable program that is installed on the Platform Manager or System Monitor. The best practice is to include the fully qualified path of the binary to be executed to avoid deliberate or inadvertent launching of a different binary.
In the case of PowerShell scripts, the command is the script engine ""powershell.exe"" with a fully qualified Windows path.
If the path to the binary cannot be resolved, the plugin fails at run time. The resulting error message in this case is a generic failure message and not indicative that the command or command path is missing or incorrect.

Very few SmartResponse Plugins are stand-alone actions that can be run without any input parameters. In fact, the main purpose of a SmartResponse is to take action based on information present in an alarm. The Action XML tag can contain Parameter tags to pass additional data into the executable defined in the Command attribute.
Parameters may be defined as one of the following:
Constant
. Constant parameters are fixed and never change. The most common use case is to pass a script name into PowerShell.
String
. String parameters can be changed when the system is deployed. Use Input subtags to map string parameters to values in the SIEM alarm. For more information on Input tags, see
52795118
.
Encrypted Parameter.
A third type of parameter tag, called EncryptedParameter, is a wrapper tag around a StringParameter. For more information, see
52795118
.
All parameters share a common set of attributes within the tag:
Name
. The name defines the parameter and is useful for understanding the intended purpose of the parameter.
Switch
. If present, the switch is the integral part of a command line parameter when named parameters are used.
Order
. The order field is used to indicate the order of the parameters. Order can contain a number indicating the parameter position, or a text value of unsorted parameters.
Switch and Order are used to indicate named or positional parameters. As a best practice, use either named or positional parameters in an action, but not both. Incorrect or blank ordering for the parameters may result in an error when creating a new SRP xml.
If you are using a mix of named parameters and ordered parameters that do not have switches, make sure that the switch field contains a single space.
Constant parameters are command-line arguments fixed for the action regardless of how the SmartResponse is initiated.
A ConstantParameter always remains the same, and cannot be configured by the user or alarm that triggers the SmartResponse Plugin. These parameters are useful for fixing a command line parameter within the context of a particular action.
A good use case for a ConstantParameter occurs when an Action tries to execute a PowerShell script called ""Sample.ps1."" The full command line for this would be ""powershell.exe –File Sample.ps1."" As discussed previously, the Action would have Command set to ""C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe."" A ConstantParameter would be set to the complete value ""-File Sample.ps1"" which indicates the script to run. In this case, we always run this script regardless of any other parameters or configuration to the SmartResponse.
In LogRhythm 7.0 or higher, the SmartResponse Switch attribute for PowerShell scripts must be in the following format: ""-File Sample.ps1"". This is because the PowerShell binary has the ability to directly ingest PowerShell cmdlets as arguments from the command line. This could lead to the SmartResponse being used for remote code execution in limited circumstances. Using the ""-File"" method of specifying the script prevents abuse of PowerShell.
String parameters are command-line arguments that may be different each time an Action is executed depending on how the LogRhythm Administrator configures the plugin for a particular alarm. A string parameter’s value can be set at either configuration time (in which case it never changes for that particular configuration) or at run time (in which case it changes every time the response executes).
String parameters allow the definition of command line switches or parameters by name using user defined strings instead of a constant that is fixed for the plugin action.
The following example would add a parameter called DisplayName. This value is passed on the command as an argument called ""address:"" as defined in the Switch attribute.
The actual value passed is extracted at runtime as either a static value set by the administrator when configuring the SmartResponse, or as a dynamic value injected from the alarm or event.
It is critical that the Switch attribute contains the complete command line switch including the prefix (most commonly ‘\’ or ‘-‘) and the delimiter (most commonly ‘:’ ‘=’ or a space). Command-line programs vary widely on how well they support variation in the switch prefix and delimiter. The only way to ensure the value provided matches expectations is to require the information in the parameter definition.
In order to execute a remediation action, all string parameters must completely resolve their arguments prior to executing the SmartResponse action. The values are determined at runtime based on how the LogRhythm administrator configures the SmartResponse for the alarm. The value might be a metadata field passed through from the alarm, or a fixed value manually set when the alarm is configured.
You can pre-define default values using Input Value tags. Input tags are optional and only used to simplify the deployment process. For more information, see
52795118
.
Encrypted Parameters modify the behavior of a String Parameter so that the value is stored with additional encryption.
An Encrypted Parameter has no options and simply wraps an existing String Parameter. Encrypted parameters identify another parameter as one whose value contains sensitive information (e.g., a password or community string). When a parameter is identified as encrypted, any input value assigned to that parameter when the SmartResponse is configured for an alarm is encrypted when it is stored in the EMDB.
Using the EncryptedParameter tag forces the executor of the plugin (the Platform Manager or System Monitor) to leverage the LRcrypt tool to encrypt the values passed in the string parameter. LRcrypt leverages Windows libraries for encryption. The default behavior is to use an AES algorithm. The actual algorithm choice depends on how the Windows environment is configured.
Use encrypted parameters sparingly since not everything is sensitive. Parameters that use information from an alarm or event do not require encryption because the information is already provided in plain text. Typically items such as passwords and API keys should be encrypted. Additionally, it is recommended that Encrypted Parameters are not provided with a Default Input Value, because that value is stored in the configuration file in plaintext and is contained within the plugin.

A String Parameter can optionally contain sub-tags that define a default value or pre-configure the value to be filled from specific metadata. Input parameters are optional in the configuration file, but reduce the time it takes to deploy and configure a SmartResponse.
Input Values can be one of the following types:
Static
. Configured by the LogRhythm administrator and does not change on a per-alarm basis.
Metadata
. Deteremined by the data contained in the alarm or event triggering the SmartResponse. These values change on every execution of the SmartResponse.
Input values are optional. Using them in the configuration file reduces the time it takes to deploy and configure a SmartResponse, but makes the configuration file more complicated.
Both Static and Metadata input values must be contained inside a DefaultInput tag:
In this example, a default static value of 127.0.0.1 is passed to the string parameter. A LogRhythm administrator can override this value when configuring the SmartResponse. The value is an initial default setting.
Static Input values are entered by the LogRhythm administrator when the SmartResponse Plugin is configured against a particular alarm rule. Once configured, these values remain the same every time the plugin is called by the specific alarm.
Using a String Parameter with a Static Default Input value is similar to using a Constant Parameter, with one exception. This pattern provides an override mechanism where the administrator can either accept the default or replace it with a new value when registering the response. Default Input values act as built in context-sensitive help or suggestions. An example of this is a SmartResponse that calls a firewall API—the administrator enters the IP address of the firewall as a Static Input value since it would always remain the same within this deployment.
Metadata Input values are dynamic values included when the SmartResponse executes. The LogRhythm administrator maps the Metadata Input to a particular alarm field when the SmartResponse Plugin is configured.
Each field of the alarm or event has its own tag that can be used to specify the intended metadata field. In the example below, the default value for the StringParameter is populated with the destination IP address of the first action associated with the alarm. For more information and a list of supported Metadata Input values, see Appendix A: Metadata Inputs on page 26.
An example of this would be a SmartResponse that is going to call a Firewall API to block a destination IP address. The administrator might select the destination IP address metadata field from the alarm as the Metadata Input value since the IP address to be blocked varies depending on the event that triggered the alarm.
Metadata field names are case sensitive. If you do not use the correct capitalization, you will get errors when you import the SmartResponse.
The following reference table provides information about the fields that are consumable by a SmartResponse plugin and additional guidance on working with date formats in the data fields. Each SmartResponse is triggered by an alarm. Depending on the alarm configuration, different fields are available for use in the SmartResponse.

Several metadata fields contain date and time stamp values. Use a TimeFormat tag to force these metadata fields to conform to the desired format.
The structure of the TimeFormat tag contains the following attributes:
TimeZone.
Allows you to configure a specific time zone to convert the date and time output. Inside the configuration the time zone is specified by the Windows ID used for the time zone (this value can be looked up within the Windows Registry under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Time Zone). If no value is provided, the time zone of the machine creating Remediation Actions is used (either the Platform Manager or the System Monitor depending on configuration).
FormattingString
. Defines the format of the date and time information. This allows you to customize which parts of the date and time are available to the executing program and what structure this information has. Omitting this option causes the date and time to be formatted by the default .NET date/time format. See the following for more information about the default .NET date/time formats:
MSDN: Standard DateTime Format Strings
MSDN: Custom DateTime Format Strings
Since both of these values are optional, there are four permutations TimeFormat can take. However, any field accepting a TimeFormat must have exactly one TimeFormat specified.
Default Values for the output format and time zone:
<remv1:TimeFormat />
Specify only the Time Zone, Use the .NET Date Time Format:
<remv1:TimeFormat TimeZone=""Eastern Standard Time"" />
Specify only the Format, Use the Event Manager’s Time Zone:
<remv1:TimeFormat FormattingString=""MMMM dd, yyyy"" />
Specify both the Format and the Time Zone:
<remv1:TimeFormat TimeZone=""Eastern Standard Time"" FormattingString=""MMMM dd, yyyy"" />
<remv1:BytesIn />

There are many ways to configure a SmartResponse Plugin to act on an alarm. You have the following options:
Determine what events trigger the SmartResponse.
Determine if there is an approval workflow.
Determine which alarm values are passed into the SmartResponse Plugin.
Configure any parameters that are environment specific.
Because of the number of options and variety of use cases, see the
SmartResponse Plugin installer guides
for more details on configuring the SmartResponse Plugin.
Additionally, many of the Threat Detection module user guides contain recommended actions sections for linking LogRhythm published SmartResponse Plugins to specific Advanced Intelligence Engine (AIE) rules. Review these guides for ideas about possible use cases for SmartResponse Plugins.

As of LogRhythm 7.2.3, you can execute an SRP from the context of the Analyzer grid in the Web Console. Any output from the SRP displays in a window inside the Web Console. This allows a new opportunity to use SRPs for context enrichment when hunting or analyzing a log, event, or alarm.
To run SmartResponse in the Web Console, you much first enable SmartResponse in LogRhythm by importing SmartResponse plugins in the Client Console. For more information, see
Import SmartResponse Plugins
.


SmartResponse Plugins use the credentials of the System Monitor Agent Service Account on hosts, or with the credentials of the ARM Service Account if launched from the Platform Manager.
Often these services use the LocalSystem Service Account.

The System Monitor Agent Service and ARM Service should be configured to run under a specific service account, rather than LocalSystem.
Use the Least Privilege User Guide to limit the privileges of the account running the System Monitor Agent or ARM Service.

SmartResponse actions may be highly privileged, or subject to attack, and should therefore be monitored. Signed PowerShell scripts can be logged by the CAPI2 Event Logging in Windows, and thus it may be validated that a LogRhythm signed script was in fact executed.
SmartResponse Plugins are delivered to System Monitor Agents and saved to the C:\Program Files\LogRhythm folder structure, in LogRhythm System Monitor\State\SmartResponse. This folder should be monitored by File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) and an AIE alarm should be created to monitor for any activity in that folder not originating with the scsm.exe process.

"Using LogRhythm's Tail tool is similar to using the Investigator. However, a Tail queries for new logs and updates your log/event list in real-time. Tail is primarily used to track real-time and near-time logs and events. The concept of the Tail command should be familiar to users of UNIX/Linux based operating systems. Tails that you save are only available to your user login.

"The LogRhythm installation includes predefined templates, reports, and Report Packages which are sets of reports that pertain to a single topic such as security compliance standards, usage auditing, or LogRhythm diagnostics. The following tasks can be performed from the Report Center:
Generate a report from a predefined report format included in the LogRhythm installation.
Generate a group of reports (a report package) from a predefined Report Package format included in the LogRhythm installation.
Generate a report from a custom format.
Copy, import, and export reports.
Create a custom template.
Import a custom report logo.
New and updated reports are loaded with the updated Knowledge Base. You must have administrative privileges to import a Knowledge Base.

A report template defines the report format including the columns, group order, and sort order. The report configuration defines the data that is included in the report. All available report templates are listed on the Report Templates tab of the Report Center page. The table below describes the columns that appear in the Report Template grid.
Category of Report Type
Alarm and Response Report
. Alarms and related events.
Audit Log Report
. Auditing activity events by user and date.
Executive Report
. Trending information for executive/management analysis.
Log Detail Report
. Raw logs and/or parsed metadata.
Log Management Statistics Report
.
Log Summary Report
. Summarized data.

There are four categories of permissions for reports:
Private
. Only the owner can run or edit the report.
Public All Users
. Only Global Administrators or the owner can edit the report, but everyone can run it.
Public Global Analysts
. Only Global Administrators or the owner can edit the report, but everyone except standard Restricted Analysts can run it.
Public Global Administrator.
Only Global Administrators or the owner can edit the report, but everyone except standard Restricted Analysts and Global Analysts can run it.
Restricted Analysts with elevated permissions have access to more functions than do standard Restricted Analysts. For more information, see
Modify User Profile Management Permissions
.
Public Global Administrator.
Only Global Administrators or the owner can edit the report, but everyone except standard Restricted Analysts and Global Analysts can run it.
Restricted Analysts with elevated permissions have access to more functions than do standard Restricted Analysts. For more information, see
Modify User Profile Management Permissions
.


If you change the Authorized User Profiles after a report has been run, users with newly granted access cannot see the report in the Web Console. You must run the report again for it to be visible to the new user profiles.

Understanding how data is retrieved, from where, and what state it is in helps determine which template to use.
In LogRhythm, all dates are stored in Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). LogMart dates use whole hour resolution. Activity occurring between the start and the end of the hour is recorded as occurring on the hour. For example, a log entry dated 1/1/10 3:34:33 PM would be associated with the aggregated occurrence record dated 1/1/10 3:00:00 PM.
Because LogMart occurrences are aggregated by the hour, reports contain results within whole hours. For example, a report run 1/1/10 5:30 AM GMT thru 1/1/10 5:30 PM GMT will actually contain results on or after 1/1/10 6:00 AM GMT and prior to 1/1/10 6:00 PM GMT.

If a report query causes Client Console memory usage to exceed the threshold, then the report is rendered with partial data and the label (Sample Dataset) is added to the title page footer:
Report prepared for LogRhythm Inc. on 1/28/11 2:00 PM MST (GMT-07:00) (Sample Dataset)
The reporting memory can be set from 0-100%. When set to 100%, the behavior is identical to LogRhythm 6.0 memory management.
The amount of application memory available to the Client Console is different for 32-bit versus 64-bit systems because 32-bit systems can only access the first 1 GB of memory.
Maximum application memory:
LogRhythm Client Console (32-bit) = 1 GB
LogRhythm Client Console (64-bit) = installed physical memory
For example, if 8 GB RAM is installed and the reporting memory threshold is set to 50%, the following amount of memory is available:
LogRhythm Client Console (32-bit) = 0.5 GB report memory threshold
LogRhythm Client Console (64-bit) = 4.0 GB report memory threshold
To adjust these values, use the Report Center tab in
My Preferences
.

The memory allocation can be distributed between the ARM and the Job Manager. In the ARM Advanced Properties settings, MaxServiceMemory has been replaced with two properties:
MaxServiceMemory_ARM. Range 512-64000 MB; Default 2048 MB
MaxServiceMemory_JobManager. Range 512-64000 MB; Default 2048 MB

Reports can be run individually or in packages. If one of more individual reports are selected, Report Center bundles the reports into an ad hoc package. Errors can occur due to factors such as connections, permissions, and timeouts.
In the ARM Advanced Properties settings, the maximum number of errors per job package can be adjusted:
SRE_MaxErrorsPerJobPackage. Range 1-100; Default 5
After the limit has been reached, the package is stopped.

In some large deployments, where scheduled reports are not finishing or timing out, the following settings may be effective at preventing timeouts. First, stagger multiple schedule report jobs so one does not cancel out the other when it executes, and ensure run time does not conflict with the LogRhythm nightly maintenance. By default, each report can take as much as 600 seconds to complete, and nightly maintenance begins at 1 AM every day.
Nightly database maintenance jobs may take hours to run.
For example, schedule your first report package to start execution at 3 AM, and allow more than 600 seconds (for each report within the package) before scheduling your second package. If your first package has six reports in it, your second report package should be scheduled to start 3600 seconds, or one hour, later.
If the above does not solve your problem, consider changing the following
advanced properties on the Platform Manager
, and recalculate the time needed between report package scheduled execution time:
SRE_QueryCommandTimeout. Change to 1800 seconds.
SRE_MaxErrorsPerJobPackage. Change from 3 to 1.
The SQL Server remote query timeout, which is 600 seconds or 10 minutes by default, is also taken into account. To view this setting, start SQL Server Management Studio, right-click the EMDB host in Object Explorer, and then click Properties. Click the Connections page, and the timeout value can be found under Remote server connections on the right.

"The LogRhythm SIEM solution, like other SIEMs, attempts to strike a balance between the relatively high cost and performance of online storage of useful log data for quick retrieval, and the more cost-effective method of storing flat archived log data. The SIEM processes log data and writes data to both the Data Indexer and the archiver concurrently. However, after log data is made available online, it expires out of the indexed persistence layer in somewhere between 30 and 90 days, depending on your configuration, and then the only option for recovery and analysis of older log data is to perform a SecondLook Restore from the LogRhythm SIEM. This process reads in relevant archive files and processes the contents based upon the filters set in the SecondLook search initiated by the end user. The pertinent log data is then stored in the archive indexer for search and analysis.
SecondLook is always available for LogRhythm Administrators. For other users, SecondLook is only available if Allow use of SecondLook is selected in the user's profile.

The SecondLook Restore is launched from a LogRhythm Client Console, which performs all the disk retrieval of archive files, log processing of raw log data, and indexer inserts of retrieved data. The actual SecondLook Restore process consists of the following underlying steps:
After the parameters of the SecondLook Restore are defined and the restore job is executed, the Client Console starts a new instance of the Message Processing Engine (MPE) that uses the selected MPE policy selected for each target log source.
The Client Console searches the provided archive paths for relevant archive files, based on the chosen log source and date/time parameters of the restore.
When the SecondLook Restore job finds a matching archive file, the Client Console performs the following:
Runs a SHA1 hash verification of the archive file (if applicable) to cross reference against the hash value of that archive file stored in the EMDB. This is to ensure that the archive file has not been tampered with since it was sealed by the archiver.
Decompresses the raw log contents of the file.
Submits the raw log contents to the MPE instance.
Processes the raw log with the selected MPE policy.
Inserts any raw log matches for provided filters (user, host, etc) to the archive indexer.

Decompresses the raw log contents of the file.
Submits the raw log contents to the MPE instance.
Processes the raw log with the selected MPE policy.
Inserts any raw log matches for provided filters (user, host, etc) to the archive indexer.
The previous step repeats until the client console has identified ALL archive files that meet the date/time and log source criteria.
The SecondLook Restore job will terminate and display relevant statistics surrounding the restore job, including number of archive files accessed, raw logs processed, and logs restored that met criteria, plus any failures encountered throughout the job.

The following list are best practices for utilizing the SecondLook Wizard to minimize time it takes to restore the logs needed.
A SecondLook Restore should not be performed on an existing Data Processor server. When it is, the two MPE instances compete for CPU resources.
Initialize the SecondLook Restore with the most precise date/time range and log source list as possible that will meet your search criteria.
The process must search though all archive paths and files using date range and log source ID as a primary filter.
Include/Exclude Filters such as user or host information only filter what logs are restored to the archive indexer, but they must still be processed by the MPE, which also happens to be the most expensive step of the SecondLook Restore process.

Include/Exclude Filters such as user or host information only filter what logs are restored to the archive indexer, but they must still be processed by the MPE, which also happens to be the most expensive step of the SecondLook Restore process.
Copy the Inactive Archive files (.LCA files) for the time period you want to the server that will be used for the SecondLook restore.
Local storage yields faster retrieval of archive files than searching archive files across a network drive, especially when the search scope includes several hundreds of thousands of potential matches.
Local storage yields faster retrieval of archive files than searching archive files across a network drive, especially when the search scope includes several hundreds of thousands of potential matches.
Use the name of the file/folder for the timestamp of the relevant logs and NOT the date/time of the file itself. The file/folder name contains the normalized datetime of the logs within that file.
Log in to the Client Console as LogRhythmAdmin or another user with the role of GlobalAdmin when performing the SecondLook restore, and ensure that the Windows user account under which the LogRhythm Client Console was launched is a local administrator.
Doing so ensures that the Client Console has adequate access to all local files/paths that contain archive files.
Doing so ensures that the Client Console has adequate access to all local files/paths that contain archive files.
If the restore period is longer than a week's worth of data, perform multiple SecondLook restores with concurrent date ranges.
This range recommendation is variable in nature, and is directly related to the amount of log data that must be searched.
Doing so keeps the process from running over several hours or days even, and raises the chance of completion so that the process does not have to be restarted.
Currently, there is no way to ""restart"" a SecondLook restore, so if it does not run to completion, then there is no way to guarantee that log data was found by the previous SecondLook Restore attempt.

Run extremely high volume deployments and/or large SecondLook timeframes, or multiple concurrent SecondLook Restores, on separate servers.
Doing so provides increased throughput of the SecondLook restore process. The workloads can be divided using log sources, date/time range, or both.
This approach works best when both SecondLook instances are pointed to the same archive file location. While this point does contradict previous the suggestion of copying archive files for local access, this approach yields more throughput at the MPE processing stage of a SecondLook Restores, which is more of a performance bottleneck than the file search process.

Tune the MPE settings of the Archive Data Processsor to use the following enhancements: LogProcessingThreads = # of physical cores minus 2 (a 32 core system would yield a thread count of 30)
The MPE policy used for a SecondLook Restore should be as ""skinny"" as possible.
The SecondLook Restore process is mostly constrained by the MPE processing of the LogRhythm client console.
MPE policy should contain as few rules as needed to identify the logs that are the target of the SecondLook Restore. This keeps the MPE performance high by not utilizing unnecessary MPE rules that do not match on relevant logs.
Individual MPE rules should parse as few data elements as possible while still yielding useful and indexed results. For instance, if the SecondLook Restore is meant to find user accounts, then the MPE rule should only parse perhaps the Event ID and the user field from the raw log message.

Disk I/O, both network shares and local disk arrays, did not come into play as evidenced by performance counters, and should be considered a secondary performance consideration behind MPE optimization.
Perform parallel restores using separate servers with dedicated resources for MPE processing, with restore jobs logically segmented by timeframe yields scalable results.

The Deployment Monitor provides Global Administrators with a near-real-time view of the performance of LogRhythm and the hosts where its components run.
Each LogRhythm Deployment panel tab contains a grid that displays descriptive, statistical, and status information for the deployment or the specific component type. The contents of each grid are refreshed every 30 seconds. The tabs are:
Component Status
. The Component Status tab shows the health of each component in a LogRhythm deployment. It always lists systems running Data Processor and Platform Manager services as part of this deployment.
Data Processors
. The Data Processors tab shows the health of the Data Processors.
AI Engines
. The AI Engines tab shows the health of the AI Engines.
Collectors
. The Collectors tab shows the health of the Collectors. Collectors are Agents which act as an aggregation point for log collection. These Agents collect data from remote, non-local log sources.
System Monitors
. The System Monitors tab shows the health System Monitor Agents and Hosts. These Agents only collect data from their local host. An Agent which is not a Collector is referred to as a Host or System Monitor.
Log Sources
. The Log Sources tab shows the health of the Log Sources.
Clusters
. The Clusters tab shows the names of the cluster in the deployment and their status.
Nodes
. The Nodes tab shows the nodes associated with this deployment and information related to them.

The Component Status tab shows the health of each component in a LogRhythm deployment. It always lists systems running Data Processor and Platform Manager services as part of this deployment. By default, the Hosts pane shows any hosts running a System Monitor Agent with a status of Critical, Warning, Notice, or Normal.

The Data Processor, Agent, AI Engine, and AI Comm Manager actively monitor themselves and Agents for a heartbeat signal at regular intervals. After receiving the signal, the database is updated with a time stamp of the last successful signal from that component. The Job Manager service regularly checks the amount of time that passed since the last successful heartbeat from each component and compares it with the component's unique Heartbeat Warning Interval setting.
If a Heartbeat is not received for one full Heartbeat Warning Interval, the Last Heartbeat field is yellow.
If a Heartbeat is not received for two full Heartbeat Warning Intervals, the Last Heartbeat field is red.
For some components, the Heartbeat Warning Interval can be modified:
Data Processor
. The Heartbeat Warning Interval can be set between 60 seconds and 86,400 seconds (1 day). To learn how to change this, see
Modify Data Processor Basic Properties
.
Platform Manager
. The Heartbeat Warning Interval cannot be changed. The default is 60 seconds.
System Monitor Agent
. The Heartbeat Warning Interval can be set between 1 minute and 30 days. To learn how to change this, see
Modify System Monitor Basic Properties
.
AI Engine and AI Comm Manager
. The Heartbeat Warning Interval cannot be changed. The default is 60 seconds.
Log Sources
. These do not have heartbeats. Instead, they use Silent Log Message Source Detection.
If the expected reporting time is greater than the Heartbeat Warning Interval, a Missing Heartbeat Warning event is generated. The warnings continue to be generated each time an additional Heartbeat Warning Interval passes without a signal. After a heartbeat is received from the component, a Heartbeat Returned event is generated and the system again waits for a missing heartbeat condition.
Set a reasonable Heartbeat Warning Interval. Take special notice of systems that reside on non-persistent connections or are removable from the network, such as notebook computers.

In order to receive an Alarm on missing heartbeats, you must
Create Alarm Rules
. There are several predefined rules that are part of the LogRhythm Diagnostics module to alarm on missed heartbeats for the AI Comm Manager, AI Engine, Data Processor, and Agent.

During the deployment of your LogRhythm solution, LogRhythm provides configuration and tuning to ensure that your solution starts at an optimal configuration for your log processing needs. The health and maintenance of your LogRhythm solution is crucial for its optimal performance.
Maintaining an effective, efficient, healthy LogRhythm deployment requires regular system maintenance and monitoring. While this does not require a lot of work from the end user, it is important to understand how to monitor the health of your solution and maintain a healthy deployment.

There are many ways to keep your system healthy, and various monitoring tools can give you a status of your deployment's health:
The
Deployment Monitor
provides a quick snapshot of the health of your system, including details such as the status of your hosts, host performance, database utilization, Data Processor metrics, and log volume statistics. It can be accessed from the Client Console by a LogRhythm Administrator.
The
LogRhythm Performance Counters
provide visibility into the performance of the various LogRhythm components.
The
Log Processing Reports
provide input into system performance and the efficiency of rules being used in log processing.
The
LogRhythm Diagnostics Tool
is a standalone application that collects log and data files from LogRhythm components, runs Platform Manager database queries, and performs health, capacity, and oversubscription analysis on a LogRhythm deployment. The data is consolidated into a local .zip file for subsequent evaluation, capacity analysis and planning, and troubleshooting.
LogRhythm Echo
is a standalone Windows application that simulates a LogRhythm System Monitor Agent and allows users to replay native raw logs and PCAPs into LogRhythm to quickly build, demo, validate, verify, and tear down security use cases. ECHO comes with more than 30 use cases ready for replay, and users can create, modify, and share use cases using the web interface or a text editor.
Centralized Service Metrics
captures all your performance counters from all your servers in the LogRhythm deployment and gathers them into one database that can be utilized to create dashboards showing the overall health of your deployment.
LogRhythm diagnostic alarm rules provide alarms to notify you of errors or warnings related to the LogRhythm components. These alarm rules are imported with the Knowledge Base and are required for all deployments. The Alarm Rule Group is LogRhythm Diagnostics. These alarms should be enabled and configured to notify Global Administrators, who are the only users who can view these alarms. They are managed from the Alarm Rules tab within Deployment Manager.
For more detailed information, you can review the log files. All LogRhythm components have log files that provide specific details of the component's state and current processing. The log files are stored in the logs folder in the location where the component files were installed (for example, C:\Program Files\LogRhythm\LogRhythm Job Manager\logs) and are also available from the component's Local Configuration Manager. The components log at a level of detail as specified in the Log Level value within the properties of the component, which is configured within the Client Console. Log Level is set to ‘info’ by default, but can be updated as necessary to provide more or less detail.

LogRhythm Oversubscription means that the number of logs being processed in your system, given how your system is currently configured, has surpassed your deployment's size and processing capacity.
LogRhythm Appliances are sized to provide different levels of processing capability. They are also configured to support optimal processing. As you start processing more logs and depending on the configuration of your Mediator and System Agent advanced properties, your deployment may need to be reconfigured or expanded to support these needs.
The Mediator and System Monitor Agent have advanced property values such as max memory, queue size, max queue size, max logs cached, and flush batch that are configured at your initial deployment to best serve your platform. If these values change, they could impact the performance of your solution and cause oversubscription to occur.
To fully understand oversubscription, an understanding of the System Monitor Agent and Mediators state and suspense handling, as well as Database capacity is required. These are described in the next section.

The System Monitor and the Mediator manage logs through queues to prevent log data loss. When these components shutdown they take whatever data they have in memory and write it to disk. Likewise, when the agent or the mediator starts up, the data on the disk is ready back into memory to continue processing.

On service shutdown, the System Monitor Agent writes its Message Queue to the state/processedlogs directory.
On service startup, the System Monitor Agent reads its Message Queue from the state/processedlogs directory.

On service shutdown, the Mediator writes its queues (unprocessed, processed, archive, loginsert, eventinsert, ldsengine) to the appropriate state directory.
On service shutdown, the Mediator writes final queue state/suspense counts to the scmedsvr.log (INFO level).
On service startup, the Mediator reads its state data file back into the queues.

A suspense state is reached when one of the following conditions is met
ArchiveQueue size > QueueSize
Available state drive disk space < 10GB (that is, disk space for suspense and state spool files)
In a suspense state, the mediator disconnects all agents and does not allow connection until resources have stabilized. Each service will spool incoming logs to disk to maintain the processing level. The component systematically reads the spooled log data files back into the queues and processes them as soon as the log rate has decreased back to its specified operating rate. The spooled suspense files live in the component’s state directory.
When a System Monitor receives more data than its current configuration can handle, it begins removing data from memory and persisting it to disk. When the Agent is no longer under the unsustainable load, it gradually reads the disk persisted data back in to continue processing.
When a Mediator receives more data than its current configuration can handle, it begins removing data from memory and persisting it to disk. When the Mediator is no longer under the unsustainable load, it gradually reads the disk persisted data back to continue processing.

Five databases exist within the LogRhythm Solution:
Platform Manager Database
. LogRhythmEMDB
Alarms Database
. LogRhythm_Alarms
Case Management Database
. LogRhythm_CMDB
Case Management Database
. LogRhythm_CMDB
Events Database
. LogRhythm_Events
LogMart Database
. LogRhythm_LogMart
The LogMart and Events databases have a time to live (TTL) setting within the Global Data Management Settings. This value determines the number of days the data for that database should be stored online before being removed by the maintenance process. Setting these values high takes up more capacity in the database.
Changing the default SQL Server Collation from “SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS” is not supported and can leave your deployment in a non-working state.

The EMDB, Alarms, CMDB, Events, and LogMart databases are set for auto growth, so they continue to grow until the host system runs out of disk space.
If disk space is not available, the LogRhythm components issue errors in the log files to indicate that there is a problem. You may see some of the following logs:
Mediator
. ***WARNING*** Suspend condition detected: The minimum disk space available for log data spool files is less than 1 GB
Agent
. CanLoadSpoolFiles=False : Reason=Agent run state not RUNNING or MaxLogQueueMemory exceeded
Agent
. ***WARNING*** Received Data Processor unavailable message from mediator 1
Enable all of the Alarm Rules in the Alarm Rule Group LogRhythm Diagnostics and configure them to notify the appropriate personnel to ensure you receive alerts.
As with any production server, disk space must be monitored. This can be set up so that LogRhythm itself is monitoring with alarms or other third party monitoring tools, that might be in the environment, are monitoring.

Each AI Engine Communication Manager has local, persistent storage for the log data files it receives from Mediators. The AI Engine reads the log data files, processes them, and then deletes the data files from the file system based on the configurable parameter MaxLogDataSize, which is the maximum amount of log data to keep on disk.
If the size of the data files exceeds the configurable amount, the AI Communication Manager begins to delete the oldest data files while continuing to write the newest logs to new data files on the file system. The AI Communication Manager writes logs to the Windows Event Log indicating that the deletions are occurring.
The value is configured in the AIEEngine.ini configuration file on the AI Engine System:
# Maximum amount of log data from Data Processors to keep on disk (in MB).
# If this amount is exceeded, the AI Engine Communication Manager will begin to delete the
# oldest data files until the data file size is less than the specified maximum.
# Values: 100-1000000 (100 MB - 1000 GB)
# Default: 2000 (2 GB)
MaxLogDataSize=2000
On the mediator side, the AI Engine data is stored in memory until the limit is reached. The data is then written out to spool files until it can be transmitted to AI Engine. When the storage limit is reached, the oldest spool file is deleted.
The parameters are configured by accessing the LogRhythm Data Processor Advanced Properties window and filtering the Name field for MaxDataQueueSize or MaxSpoolStorage. For more information on configuring these parameters, see Configure Data Processor Properties.
As with any production server, disk space must be monitored. This can be set up so that LogRhythm itself is monitoring with alarms or other third party monitoring tools that might be in the environment are monitoring.
LogRhythm has several maintenance jobs that age data from the databases and rebuild indexes to maintain efficient search functions. If the maintenance jobs do not run, it will have an impact on your system and could create suspense conditions and fill the databases to capacity.
The database maintenance jobs are implemented as SQL Server Agent jobs. Two jobs are in place on any LogRhythm database server:
LogRhythm Weekday Maintenance
. Runs Monday-Friday at a default time of 12:15 AM.
Platform Manager Sunday Maintenance
. Runs Sunday at a default time of 12:15 AM.
Two additional jobs appear on Platform Managers only:
LogRhythm Backup.
Called by the Platform Manager Sunday Maintenance Job.
Delete Old Database Backups.
This job, disabled by default, will clean up old database backup files that are older than the value for Database Backup Days to Keep, set in [LogRhythmEMDB]
.
[dbo]
.
[SCMaint].
Delete Old Database Backups.
This job, disabled by default, will clean up old database backup files that are older than the value for Database Backup Days to Keep, set in [LogRhythmEMDB]
.
[dbo]
.
[SCMaint].
Each job comprises individual steps that perform a specific maintenance function.
It is critical that the SQL Server Agent service be running on all LogRhythm database servers to ensure that all maintenance is performed on schedule.
To ensure that the Startup Type is set to Automatic and that the Status is Started, open the Services application and find
SQL Server Agent (MSSQLSERVER)
on the list.

LogRhythm is designed to run with a minimum of required maintenance. However, as with any complex system, a LogRhythm Deployment can benefit from periodic assessment, maintenance, and tuning.
LogRhythm’s Health Check and Tune-Up Services are designed to regularly assess a customer’s deployment and ensure it is fully operational and functioning.
You can read more about these services on the
LogRhythm
website. To learn more or to sign up for these services, contact your Customer Relationship Manager.

LogRhythm has implemented performance counters within its Windows service components to provide visibility into their performance. This topic includes descriptions for the performance counters and guidance in how to interpret them to evaluate component performance.
Windows performance counters provide parameters within a Microsoft Windows operating system or Windows applications / services that can be monitored in real-time. Typically, the Microsoft Performance Monitor application is used to monitor and chart performance counter data in real-time. The data is also frequently used by third party monitoring systems to gauge the health of computer systems and the applications running on them
Performance Monitoring can be accessed via Administrative Tools or by typing perfmon at the command prompt.

You use performance counters primarily for diagnosing application performance or a specific error.

The MPE, a component of the Mediator Server service, keeps a record of how many times a rule has been compared to a log message and the total amount of time spent processing logs against each rule. This is accomplished by writing two logs: lps_detail.log which generates detailed statistics for a log processing policy for a given period of time; lps_policysortingstats.log which compiles a log per second rate of the policy over time. These reports give valuable input into system performance and the efficiency of rules being used in processing.
To send your report to LogRhythm automatically, configure the following parameters in the MPE component, and General group, of the

The LogRhythm Diagnostics Tool is a standalone application that collects log and data files from LogRhythm components, runs Platform Manager database queries, and performs health, capacity, and oversubscription analysis on a LogRhythm deployment. The data is consolidated into a local .zip file for subsequent evaluation, capacity analysis and planning, and troubleshooting.
The LogRhythm Diagnostics Tool is made up of two components—the Diagnostics Tool itself and the LogRhythm Diagnostics Agent. The Diagnostics Agent must be installed on each LogRhythm Windows node (Platform Manager, Data Processor, and AI Engine) in the deployment.

For LogRhythm Customer Support technicians, determining the cause of problems coming in from the field requires manually collecting log files, performance counters, SQL table data and job histories, Elasticsearch index data, configuration files, state repositories, and more. The LogRhythm technician must request files and other data from each component in the deployment, and often must help the customer gather that data. If the deployment is more than an XM, this means gathering data from more than one machine, a process that is time-consuming and could lead to human error.
The LogRhythm Diagnostics Tool allows customers and LogRhythm technicians to perform deep analysis of a LogRhythm deployment’s operational characteristics by accessing, executing, and interpreting results with ease. The tool enables users to gather all pertinent logs, metrics, queries, counters, and other data from a LogRhythm deployment quickly, easily, consistently, and locally—there are no online components. All data collection is read-only, so there is negligible performance impact on the deployment itself.
Users can also determine whether the deployment is healthy and in specification with respect to platform and licensing settings. If the deployment is not in a good state, the Diagnostics Tool provides all the logs and data in one local .zip file for further analysis by either the LogRhythm Administrator at the customer site or the LogRhythm support technician who receives the .zip file from the customer support ticket.

The LogRhythm Diagnostics Tool offers the following functionality. For a full list of log files and data points collected and consolidated by the Diagnostics Tool, see
Log Files and Data Collected by the Diagnostic Tool
.
Provides the current performance and capacity of the LogRhythm SIEM data pipeline, as measured against the Sustained Rate and Peak Rate definitions published by LogRhythm Solutions.
Empirically demonstrates where the deployment is operating against the prescribed rates. Illustrates how much capacity remains before the deployment would be considered oversubscribed, or if the deployment is already oversubscribed.
Automates the analysis of a deployment’s current data processing pipeline, per the Solutions Sizing Guide. This analysis makes it easy for field personnel and even customers to understand the deployment’s current capacity and performance.
Installs and runs as a standalone application on any Windows host that can access LogRhythm Diagnostics Agents, consolidates files and data on a Windows host into a .zip file, and presents the files and data for immediate review.
Collects files and data in a passive, read-only manner. Collected data includes information about LogRhythm components, the operating systems that host those components, and the hardware that runs on those hosts.
Does not make changes to the LogRhythm SIEM deployment during operation.
Runs on many versions of LogRhythm SIEM (currently 7.3.x and later).

The LogRhythm Diagnostics Tool is a standalone application that collects log files and data from a LogRhythm deployment and consolidates the collected information into a local .zip file. The tool also provides automated performance and oversubscription analysis and presents the information for immediate review and problem determination.

LogRhythm users need a straightforward way to:
Test the AI Engine (AIE) and Alarm rules that their analysts develop so they know that Alarms will generate as expected and that users can reliably and repeatedly replicate the inputs to the rule.
Verify out-of-the-box (OOTB) AIE, Alarm, and Message Processing Engine (MPE) content, MPE rule regression and performance testing, and system load and stress testing.
Demonstrate LogRhythm’s capabilities to prospects, customers, partners, and system integrators.
Seamlessly author new use cases as needed to demonstrate or verify system behaviors—such as ransomware, financial fraud, and data exfiltration—that are specific to the target environment.
LogRhythm Echo provides these capabilities. Echo is a standalone Windows application with web and command line interfaces that simulates a LogRhythm System Monitor Agent and allows users to replay native raw logs and PCAPs into LogRhythm for demonstration, validation, and verification purposes. Easy to install, configure, and use, Echo leverages OOTB log source types and processing rules to enable users to quickly build, demo, validate, verify, and tear down security use cases. Echo comes with more than 30 use cases ready for replay, and users can create, modify, and share use cases using the web interface or a text editor.

Echo’s features allow users to:
Load more than 30 verified, consistent, proven use cases that are easy to understand and explain.
Use OOTB content for log source types, processing rules, AIE rules, and Alarm rules. Automatically create and delete required objects in the Platform Manager database.
Quickly build, validate, demo, and tear down security use cases to test their LogRhythm deployment.
Edit the included use cases and create new ones.
Employ exotic log source types to create compelling and targeted security use cases.
Use the LLX File Browser to add raw logs from the deployment to use cases.
Import and export use cases, including raw logs and PCAPs, to share with other users.
On-demand and continuous/predetermined use case replay.
Use case log replay through a simulated Agent in native formats, such as APIs, Syslog, NetFlow, Check Point, flat files, and more. There are no custom log source types, raw logs, or special tags required.
Run use cases by invoking the REST API from the command line (for instance, using cURL) or your favorite scripting language (such as PowerShell).

This guide provides information about the TrueIdentity Sync Client and how to use the tool to import identity information into your deployment.
If you have installed a previous version of the TrueIdentity Sync Client, you must uninstall the previous version before installing version 1.4.0.
The TrueIdentity Sync Client queries Identity and Access Management (IAM) platforms, such as Active Directory, to create and update TrueIdentities in your LogRhythm deployment. The TrueIdentity Sync Client can be scheduled to run on a continuous basis, automatically creating and updating new TrueIdentities as they appear in your IAM.
If using a remote TrueIdentity Sync Client, your network, Active Directory LDAP server, and the host running the TrueIdentity Sync Client must support TLS 1.2.
Active Directory is the only IAM supported in this release. If you are using a different IAM, you can get identity data using LogRhythm's REST-based Admin API.
Syncing multiple Active Directory domains with overlapping users could cause conflicts. Conflicts occur when multiple TrueIdentities have the same Identifiers, and LogRhythm is unable to assign a TrueIdentity. The following is recommended:
If you have 100% overlap between AD Domains, consider only syncing one domain.
If you have partial overlap between AD Domains, leverage the Sync Client Filter to remove the overlapping accounts.
Disable Identifiers from TrueIdentity Administration in the Web Console.
Remove the overlapping Identifiers field from one of the Sync Jobs.
Sync TrueIdentities into specific entities.
Merge overlapping TrueIdentities or disable conflicting Identifiers via the LogRhythm Admin API. For more information on the LogRhythm Admin API,
see the
Admin API
documentation
.

LogRhythm SIEM 7.3 or later.
Read-only access to the LogRhythm EMDB and LogMart SQL Server databases. SQL client connections use TCP port 1433. For instructions on setting up a least-privilege, read-only SQL Server user for this purpose, see
Create a Least-Privilege SQL Server User for Querying LogRhythm Databases
.
The LogRhythm Diagnostics Agent must be installed on each LogRhythm Windows component node (Platform Manager, Data Processors, AI Engines, and standalone Web Consoles). The Diagnostics Agent is required even for single-node LogRhythm XM deployments.
For Data Indexer (DX) connections, the Diagnostics Tool application (client) uses SSH/SFTP to query system information and collect log data and does not require a Diagnostics Agent.
For Data Indexer (DX) connections, the Diagnostics Tool application (client) uses SSH/SFTP to query system information and collect log data and does not require a Diagnostics Agent.
The LogRhythm Diagnostics Tool application (client) must be installed on a Windows host that has TCP 1433 connectivity to the Platform Manager, TCP 22 connectivity to each Data Indexer, and TCP 33334 connectivity to each Diagnostics Agent on each Windows component.
If there is firewall software on the LogRhythm components hosting the Diagnostics Agent, a rule must be enabled for the Diagnostics Agent’s incoming port (default is 33334).
Ensure that your firewall allows you to download the installer and reference materials from the
LogRhythm Community
, and that your antivirus software allows the installation of the Diagnostics Agent and Diagnostics Tool.


As part of the Diagnostics Agent installation, a Windows Service called “LogRhythm Diagnostics Agent” is installed on your system. The software installs to C:\Program Files\LogRhythm\LogRhythm Diagnostics Agent, and configuration is accessible via the LogRhythm Diagnostics Agent Windows shortcut.
Run the LogRhythm Diagnostics Agent installer, available on the
LogRhythm Community
.
When the installer is finished, the configuration window appears.
Configure the following settings in the LogRhythm Diagnostics Agent user interface:
Agent Configuration
IP Address.
The public routable IP address of the LogRhythm Windows host.
This is the IP address of the host running the Agent, not the host running the LogRhythm Diagnostics Tool.
Port.
Configurable port—the default is 33334.
Log Level.
Logging is set to Informational by default, but for troubleshooting purposes, logging level can be set to Debug level.
Authentication Configuration
User Name.
User-supplied username for HTTP basic authentication. This value does not need to be an existing LogRhythm or Windows user account.
Password.
User-supplied password for HTTP basic authentication.
The basic HTTP authentication credentials and port for each Diagnostics Agent are used to configure and authenticate LogRhythm nodes on the Settings page in the LogRhythm Diagnostics Tool.
A Diagnostics Agent is Windows-only and is not installed on LogRhythm Linux DX nodes—for these nodes, valid SSH credentials are used for authentication.
The password is salted (512 bytes) and hashed (HMAC-SHA512). The username, salt, and hash are stored in the AgentConfig.json file in the ProgramData directory of the Agent system. The ProgramData directory is read-only except for administrators. Users can configure mutual, certificate-based authentication for the Agent service and the Client application. For more information, see the next section.
(Optional)
HTTPS SSL Certificate Configuration
HTTPS is used for communication between the Diagnostics Tool and individual Diagnostics Agents. By default, the Diagnostics Agent uses a dynamically generated self-signed server certificate. For additional security, users can utilize their own self-signed certificates, a valid third-party signed certificate, or a valid certificate from their PKI infrastructure.
Use Generated Certificate.
Select this option to use a dynamically generated self-signed certificate (default).
Use Certificate From Store.
Select this option to use your own certificate. This option assumes that a usable certificate is already in the server’s certificate store.
When using a certificate from the local certificate store, the certificate’s private key must be exportable. If the certificate is a valid signed-certificate, the certificate must have a root signing certificate in the machine’s Trusted Root Certificate store.

Typically, the LogRhythm Diagnostics Tool installs on the Platform Manager or XM. However, the Diagnostics Tool does not need to be installed on the LogRhythm deployment itself. The Diagnostics Tool requires TCP 1433 connectivity to the PM, TCP 22 connectivity to Linux DX nodes, and connectivity (default TCP 33334) to the LogRhythm Diagnostics Agents. The application installs to C:\Program Files\LogRhythm\LogRhythm Diagnostics.
Run the LogRhythm Diagnostics Tool installer, available on the
LogRhythm Community
.
Launch the application—click
Start
, click
LogRhythm
, and then click
LogRhythm Diagnostics
.
The LogRhythm Diagnostics login page appears.
Enter the Platform Manager IP address, a suitable LogRhythm EMDB database account name, and the account password. For high availability (HA) deployments, use the virtual IP address (VIP) or shared address for the Platform Manager. To create a SQL Server user for the Diagnostics Tool to use, see
Create a Least-Privilege SQL Server User for Querying LogRhythm Databases
.
The LogRhythmAdmin user is not supported in the LogRhythm Diagnostics client.

Customers can now tell when their services are down, memory is too high, and CPU is spiking for each system in their deployment or for their deployment as a whole. Using Kapacitor, an alerting engine that works with InfluxDB, customers can set up alerts to let them know when their LogRhythm system is not performing well.
This feature is enabled by default as part of the Common Components installation. The Metrics Collection service are installed on all components you wish to collect metrics from. The Metrics Database and Metrics Web UI services are installed on only one server in the deployment, the Platform Manager.
This feature was created to give us an out-of-band solution to display health of the LogRhythm deployment. It will speed up troubleshooting on issues because we can look at the deployment as a whole rather than individual pieces of it.

There are three services associated with Metrics Collection. The Metrics Collection service is pushed out as part of the Common Components installation. The Metrics Database and Metrics Web UI services are installed on the Platform Manager. Metrics Collection is the service that gathers all the metrics from the server it is installed on and sends them to the Metrics Database to store. The Metrics Database stores the data for a default length of seven days and the Metrics Web UI retrieves the data when a dashboard is configured to view the metrics.

The Metrics Collection service utilizes Telegraf to collect performance metrics from the system it runs on. It listens for StatsD formatted metrics on the local host over UDP port 8125 for Windows servers only. It collects system information such as Disk, RAM, CPU, and Port metrics on all systems. It then forwards these metrics to the Metrics Database over TCP port 8076.

The Metrics Database service listens externally on port 8076 for the traffic coming from the Metrics Collection service. It utilizes InfluxDB as a persistence layer for time-series metrics and stores them for a default of seven days in 8.0.0. This storage amount may be increased in a future release.

The Metrics Web UI shows all the gathered data. It utilizes Grafana to display and explore the data.

The LogRhythm Metrics Services provides dashboards for the following components and services:

The logs for all Common Components are handled by procman-beta so old log files are cleaned up. The most you should have on a system per service is 50MB.
Logs for Metrics Collection are located in C:\Program Files\LogRhythm\LogRhythm Common\logs. The LogRhythm Metrics Collection.log is available on all LogRhythm appliances.
Logs for LogRhythm Metrics services are located at C:\Program Files\LogRhythm\LogRhythm Metrics\logs. The LogRhythm Metrics Database.log and LogRhythm Metrics Web UI.log are only available on one server in your deployment, usually the Platform Manager.

The Day and Time Criteria tab of the Filter Editor allows you to define the time span within which an event must occur to trigger an alarm. For example, when both these things are true:
The day and time search criteria is 3/4/10 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM.
An aggregate log message exists with three logs that occur between 12:30 PM and 3:00 PM of 3/4/10.
The log message will be included in the search results because an occurrence may fall within the 1:00-2:00 time span.
To configure day and time criteria
Confirm that the correct time zone is selected on the Day and Time Criteria tab.
Click
Add
.
A row is added to the list with a start and end for the day and time.
To modify the Start Day and End Day fields, click the down-arrow at the right and select an option from the list.
To modify the Start Time and End Time fields, click the down-arrow at the right and select AM or PM from the list, and then enter the hour.
Repeat steps 2 through 4 until you have entered all the time constraints required for this rule.
When you complete the Day and Time Criteria tab, click

"You can create a GLPR using the Global Log Processing Rule Manager or using a log message that is returned by a Tail or an Investigation. The process of defining the rule criteria is the same for each method.
If a log does not match GLPR filter criteria, it is processed according to the Classification Based Data Management (CBDM) or standard Data Management settings.
Example 1: Create a GLPR to override indexing, and the override specifies Don't Index:
A log does not match the GLPR filter criteria.
The classification is set to index based on a Global Classification setting in CBDM.
In this case, the log will be indexed.
Example 2: Create a GLPR to override indexing, and the override specifies Don't Index:
A log matches the GLPR filter criteria.
The classification is set to index based on a Global Classification setting in CBDM.
In this case, the log will not be indexed.
To create a rule from a Tail or an Investigation, right-click one of the logs or events, and then click
Create Global Log Processing Rule
. You will be prompted to define some of the rule criteria using most of the metadata in the log message or a limited set of the metadata. After selecting the metadata option for the rule criteria, the Global Log Processing Rule Wizard appears. Skip to step 4 in the following procedure.
To create a GLPR:

"The Log Distribution Services (LDS) allows you to forward specified syslog and non-syslog log messages to an external syslog receiver over TCP or UDP. This flexibility allows you to forward log messages in a format and configuration that best meets your needs.
Global Administrators can configure LDS from the LogRhythm Client Console through the Log Distribution Policy Manager or the Log Distribution Receiver Manager.

During Data Processor initialization, the Mediator starts the LDS Engine automatically and logs the result to scmedsvr.log.
During startup, the LDS Engine creates its own log file, ldsengine.log, in the Mediator logs directory.
If the Mediator is shut down or restarted, the LDS Engine spools out any unsent logs to disk in the Mediator directory under \state\LDS_Spool\, and a log message is written to ldsengine.log.

When forwarding a message from a syslog source, Log Distribution Services always preserves the original Priority value. For non-syslog sources, the Priority value is based on your selection from the Facility list and the following formula.
The Priority Formula is Priority = Facility * 8 + Severity.

The System Database Usage widget
is only available to Global Admins or Restricted Admins with elevated View and Manage privileges.
The System Database Usage widget allows you to easily monitor database levels by showing the percentage of each database that is currently being used.
The default chart setting for the System Database Usage widget displays the usage of the following five databases.
Alarms Database
. Data related to all alarms, alarm notifications, and alarm histories generated by the LogRhythm Alarming and Response Manager (ARM).
Events Database
. Log data that qualified as an Event.
Platform Manager Database (EMDB)
. All configuration information.
LogMart
. Log metadata that qualified as an Event, or data that was sent because of a processing rule. Also includes tracking statistics for the log data volume.
Case Management Database (CMDB)
. Data for all cases as well as most of the associated evidence.
The widget provides a visual indicator when database usage is high. The colored bar that represents the usage of each database changes from blue to orange when the database’s usage exceeds the configured high usage percentage. The default setting for the high usage indicator for each database is 75%. The databases are shown in order from high usage to low usage and adjust automatically to changes.
To configure the System Database Usage widget to show and hide the percentages of databases that are being used:
Hover your mouse over the widget and click the
Settings
icon.
A blue border appears around the widget and the Inspector panel opens on the right.
In the Inspector panel, do any of the following:
Click in the
Title
field and type a new title.
Select or clear the
check box
corresponding to each database to display it or remove it from the widget.
Set the High Usage Indicator for each visible database. The default value is 75%. To set a custom value for the widget, click in the value field and then type a new value.

The Current Processing Rate widgets
are only available to Global Admins or Restricted Admins with elevated View and Manage privileges.
Current Processing Rate widgets display charts representing the processing rates of any one of the following data sets:
Log Rate (MPS)
. The messages per second (MPS) rate of log messages processed by the Data Processors Message Processing Engine (MPE).
AI Engine Rate
. The rate of logs processed by the Advanced Intelligence (AI) Engine (provided that an AI Engine has been integrated into your LogRhythm SIEM deployment). Note: The Data may not send a copy of every log to the AI Engine for processing, depending on how the administrator defined the Global Log Processing Rules in the Client Console. Consequently, the AI Engine rate may differ from the log rate.
Event Rate
. The rate of events processed per second in the Log Manager.
Alarm Rate
. The rate of alarms processed per second in the Platform Manager.
AI Engine Event Rate
. The rate of events processed per second in the AI Engine(provided that an AI Engine has been integrated into your LogRhythm SIEM deployment).
The default chart setting for the Current Processing Rate widget, which can be seen on the predefined Executive Dashboard layout for Global Administrators, shows the log messages per second (MPS) rate of the Data Processor in your deployment. The number in the middle of the chart (""20"" in the following example) is the average MPS rate in the last three minutes (excluding the current minute). The smaller numbers on the left and right show the minimum and maximum MPS rates over the last 24 hours.

Review your processing rate charts periodically and observe the volume of data as it is collected, processed, and analyzed. If the numbers are different from what you expect, you should investigate for possible security or operational issues.
To configure Current Processing Rate widgets to show different types of SIEM data sets:
Hover your mouse over the widget and click the
Settings
icon.
A blue border appears around the widget and the Inspector panel opens on the right.
In the Inspector panel, do any of the following:
Click in the

The Threat Activity Map widget provides instant visibility into the geographical origin of log data in your deployment as well as visibility into which locations are impacted by log data in your deployment. The Threat Activity Map widget provides analysts with a starting point for investigating areas of the world that appear to have activities of interest.
To ensure that the Threat Activity Map widget is working properly, you must enable the GeoLocation IP resolver on all of your Data Processors. To enable GeoLocation, set the GeoIPResolutionMode property to Country, Region, or City in the Data Processor Advanced Properties. The City level provides the most detailed information. For more information, see
Data Processor
in the Client Console (Administrator's Guide).
For more information on what to do if the Threat Activity Map widget is not properly displaying data, see
Troubleshoot Threat Activity Map
.
The Threat Activity Map widget displays log data containing location metadata. Any dashboard-level filters do not apply to the Threat Activity Map.

The Threat Activity Map widget is displayed and managed through the Threat Activity Map widget widget, which automatically appears in the widget menu on the Dashboards page for all Global Administrators and Global Analysts. For more information about adding widgets to dashboards, see
Add Widgets
.

The widget's minimum size is 3 columns by 2 rows, but it can be expanded to take up a larger area. For more information on resizing widgets, see
Resize Widgets
.
The Threat Activity Map widget plots the volume of events occurring in the environment based on the location data available in the Data Indexer. The map performs live updates and adjusts the plotted points based on new logs entering the Data Indexer.
Your Threat Activity Map widget only shows events from live clusters. If one or more clusters in your deployment goes down, data from those clusters are no longer represented in your Threat Activity Map widget and a status indicator appears in the Inspector panel. The time stamp at the top of the widget shows the date and time that the map was last updated.

The nodes in the Threat Activity Map widget widget represent events happening in your environment around the world. Nodes on the map change size based on the relative volume of events in each location. Areas with more events have larger nodes.
Nodes are automatically aggregated by the proximity of activities. The aggregation of data in a node is not always aggregated at the country/region/city level. For example, if there is activity in France, The Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany, a single node may represent the data for all of these areas when the map is zoomed out.
When you zoom in, the log data for a larger node is split into smaller nodes to show more specific locations where threat activity is occurring.

Nodes appear as pie charts and give a visual indication of how many times the location contained the origin of activity and/or how many times it was the impacted location. You can configure the nodes to show only origin, only impacted, or origin and impacted information.
To see a breakdown of the types of events represented by the pie chart, hover over the node. For more specific information about threat activity, you must drill down to see the specific log data.

"If the Threat Activity Map widget is not showing any data, here are some ways to troubleshoot the problem:
Ensure that GeoLocation data is turned on in your deployment.
Install and properly configure your data indexer(s).
Verify that all Data Indexerservices are running.
Verify that all Web Services are running.
Verify that you have events in your deployment that happened in the last 48 hours and that they contain GeoLocation information.
Check the date range of your Threat Activity Map widget widget to ensure that the range includes ample time for your last piece of data.
Adjust the polling rate to reduce the load on the environment. This adjustment is done in the Configuration tool.
If you still do not have any data, try running a search from the Searches page. For more information on running a search, see
Use Search
. If your searches are failing and if you have no data in your Threat Activity Map widget, there may be a problem with your Data Indexer configuration.
Try one of the following:
Go to your Data Indexer configuration page and verify that your EMDB Host and Public IPs are set correctly. For more information, see
Data Indexer
.
Go to your Data Indexer configuration page and verify that your EMDB Host and Public IPs are set correctly. For more information, see
Data Indexer
.
In the NGPNode table of your EMDB, verify that the nodes listed are accurate and healthy. Remove rows referring to any nodes not in use. Contact
LogRhythm customer support
for assistance, if needed.

"Case statuses fall into four different buckets: open Incidents, closed Incidents, open non-Incidents, and closed non-Incidents. Case Trend by Status charts provide visual representations of case statuses and activity in terms of A) the number of cases created at different points in time and B) the relationship between the time cases were created and their current status.
In Case Trend by Status charts, the horizontal axis plots the range of creation times while the vertical axis measures the total number of cases created. Color-coded stacked bars are used to break down the current statuses of the cases.
Case Trend by Status charts include interactive features that allow you to do the following:
To view the count values within a stacked bar, hover your cursor over the different color segments to display them. The tooltip displays the number of cases for the highlighted segment, as well as a breakdown of the number of cases that are incidents or non-incidents.
To focus the chart on a single status, hover your cursor over a status in the chart key below the horizontal axis. The tooltip displays the total number of cases for that status.
Depending on a chart's width (as defined by the number of dashboard columns that it spans) and the scope of its time range, data bars may represent a group of consecutive dates as opposed to the single dates listed along the horizontal axis. For instance, group dates are standard for one- and two-column charts with time ranges greater than 10 days.
To determine the exact date span that each bar represents, hover your cursor over the dates along the horizontal axis to display the information.

Disabled
Specify the interface to receive syslog data. This is either an IP address (recommended) or a numeric value of an interface card.
An IP address value is the static IP address of the NIC where syslog is receiving data. A numeric value (0 – 99) should be the number of the first available network interface card.
Check to enable parsing TCP syslog messages using additional delimiters: '\r' and '\0'. If unchecked, only '\r\n' and the standard newline character '\n' is used.
TCP syslog delimiter descriptions:
'\n

'\r'
- CR, Carriage return, 13 in decimal
‘\r\n’
- CRLF, CR+LF, 13 10 in decimal
'\0'
- NULL, 00 in decimal, usage = Juniper Netscreen Firewall
For an example of how to use these values to utilize custom certificates for Agent to Mediator communications, see

"Complete the following to configure a secure syslog agent.

When using secure syslog, log messages are encrypted and sent over the network using SSL/TLS. When syslog is enabled, the default setting is for the sending syslog clients to connect to the Agent (syslog server) without using an SSL client certificate.  The default setting for the Agent is to use a self-signed and self-generated SSL server certificate. For more information, see
Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) Support
.
To enable the LogRhythm Agent to listen for incoming syslog messages for both standard syslog and secure syslog:
In the Client Console, on the main toolbar, click the
Deployment Manager
.
Right-click the System Monitor you want to configure, and then click
Properties
Click the
Syslog and Flow Settings
tab, then select
Enable Syslog Server.
When the Enable Syslog Server box is checked, the Agent listens for incoming syslog messages using the ports configured in the Agent’s Advanced settings.  The default settings use the standard IANA port numbers:
Standard syslog
. UDP/TCP port 514
Secure syslog
. TCP port 6514
Standard syslog
. UDP/TCP port 514
Secure syslog
. TCP port 6514
The minimum configuration is to enable the syslog server in the Agent’s configuration and syslog clients should immediately be able to establish secure connections to the Agent.

If the Agent uses a self-generated server certificate (default), the syslog clients do not need to import the server certificate's signing certificates into their certificate store.  In this case, the Agent generates a new server certificate every time it is restarted, so any saved certificates in the syslog client system become irrelevant. Using a self-generated certificate encrypts data while it is traveling through the network, but does not ensure sender/receiver authentication.
To ensure both encryption and authentication, users can specify their own Agent (server) certificate as well as check the integrity of the syslog client by requiring it to present a client certificate.

The instructions below describe how to configure the Agent to use a custom SSL server certificate and how to generate the server certificate using OpenSSL (downloadable from
www.openssl.org
).
To create a custom server certificate and private and public keys using OpenSSL:
Install the OpenSSL package, or extract the OpenSSL files to the directory C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\SSL if using Windows operating system.
The OpenSSL executable expects the “openssl.cnf” file to be located in the C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\SSL directory. Ensure that you copy it there from the C:\OpenSSL\bin folder.
The openssl.cnf file is the main configuration file for the certificate. This certificate allows the syslog clients to establish a secure connection to the LR Agent using either the Agent's host name, fully qualified host name, or IP address. See the following example:
[ req ]
default_bits = 2048
distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name
req_extensions = req_ext
[ req_distinguished_name ]
countryName = US # 2 letter code for country name
stateOrProvinceName = Califoria # State or Province Name (full name)
localityName = Los Angeles # city or locality name
organizationName = Acme Mfg # company name
commonName = LRAgent12 # e.g. server name or IP address
[ req_ext ]
subjectAltName = @alt_names
[alt_names]
DNS.1 = LRAgent12.AcmeMfg.com
IP.1 = 10.2.0.5
Install the OpenSSL package, or extract the OpenSSL files to the directory C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\SSL if using Windows operating system.
The OpenSSL executable expects the “openssl.cnf” file to be located in the C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\SSL directory. Ensure that you copy it there from the C:\OpenSSL\bin folder.
The openssl.cnf file is the main configuration file for the certificate. This certificate allows the syslog clients to establish a secure connection to the LR Agent using either the Agent's host name, fully qualified host name, or IP address. See the following example:
[ req ]
default_bits = 2048
distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name
req_extensions = req_ext
[ req_distinguished_name ]
countryName = US # 2 letter code for country name
stateOrProvinceName = Califoria # State or Province Name (full name)
localityName = Los Angeles # city or locality name
organizationName = Acme Mfg # company name
commonName = LRAgent12 # e.g. server name or IP address
[ req_ext ]
subjectAltName = @alt_names
[alt_names]
DNS.1 = LRAgent12.AcmeMfg.com
IP.1 = 10.2.0.5
Generate the Agent SSL Key using the following command:
openssl.exe req -x509 -days 1825 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout C:\LogRhythm\agent_key.pem -out C:\LogRhythm\agent_cert_private.pem
The Common Name must be the IP address of the Agent server.
Generate the Agent SSL Key using the following command:
openssl.exe req -x509 -days 1825 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout C:\LogRhythm\agent_key.pem -out C:\LogRhythm\agent_cert_private.pem
The Common Name must be the IP address of the Agent server.
Generate the Agent Private Key using the following command:
openssl.exe pkcs12 -export -in C:\LogRhythm\agent_cert_private.pem -inkey C:\LogRhythm\agent_key.pem -out C:\LogRhythm\agent_cert.pfx
Export the Public Key from the certificate using the following command:
openssl.exe pkcs12 -in C:\LogRhythm\agent_cert.pfx -clcerts -nokeys -out C:\LogRhythm\agent_cert_public.pem
The following files should now have been created.
agent_cert.pfx
agent_cert_private.pem
agent_cert_public.pem
agent_key.pem
agent_cert.pfx
agent_cert_private.pem
agent_cert_public.pem
agent_key.pem

"LogRhythm is Public Key Enabled (PKE) and supports Public Key Infrastructures (PKI). The application supports Common Access Cards (CAC) so users can log in to the LogRhythm Client Console using CAC windows credentials and run the LogRhythm services using CAC certificates for client/server TLS communications.

LogRhythm services can operate in several modes that allow for increasing levels of security. By default, the SIEM server services (for example, Mediator Server, AIE Communications Manager, SQL Server) use a self-generated server certificate to authenticate themselves to the client components that connect to them — System Monitors, AIE Data Providers, SQL Server clients). By default, the client components do not provide a client certificate to the servers – they are unauthenticated (one-way authentication). A better authentication method employs user-provided server certificates for these server services. The best authentication method employs user-provided server certificates AND user-provided client certificates for the client services — mutual authentication.

Server services (LogRhythm and Microsoft SQL Server) use self-generated, self-signed server certificates:
The Mediator service generates a self-signed server certificate at process start-up and uses that to establish TLS connections with System Monitor Agents. The key size depends on the value set for
MinAgentSocketSecurity
in the
Data Processor Advanced Properties
:
2048-bit key, if
MinAgentSocketSecurity
is set to TLS 1.2
1024-bit key, if
MinAgentSocketSecurity
is set to TLS 1.0
2048-bit key, if
MinAgentSocketSecurity
is set to TLS 1.2
1024-bit key, if
MinAgentSocketSecurity
is set to TLS 1.0
The AIE Communication Manager service generates a self-signed server certificate at start-up and uses that to establish TLS connections with AIE Data Providers.
The Web UI Server service generates a self-signed server certificate at start-up and uses that to establish TLS connections with web clients.
The Common bundle generates a self-signed sever certificate at start-up for TLS connections with LR components.
The SQL Server service generates a self-signed server certificate at process start-up and uses that to establish TLS connections with the LogRhythm components.
Client services (System Monitor, AIE Data Provider, SQL Server clients) do NOT present a client certificate when connecting to the server services.

Support for user-specified TLS certificates for Windows/UNIX System Monitor Agent (client) and Mediator (server) communications (one- and two-way authentication).
Support for user-specified TLS certificates for AIE Data Provider (client, in the Mediator) and AIE Communication Manager (server) communications (one- and two-way authentication).
Support for user-specified TLS certificates for the Web UI Server (server, nginx) and web clients (browsers).
Support for user-specified TLS certificates for the Data Indexer server.
Support for user-specified TLS certificates for SQL Server (server). This certificate is used to authenticate and encrypt communications between SQL Server and the LogRhythm components: Client and Web Consoles, Mediator, ARM, Job Manager, and AIE Engine. Note that SQL Server does not support client certificates (one-way authentication only).

"LogRhythm and SQL Server support any certificates that the Windows operating system can support, including certificates using SHA1 through SHA512 for the signature algorithm.
This topic provides information about configuring certificate information for LogRhythm components. Please note the following:
For LogRhythm client and server certificates, the Subject name can be the FQDN, short name, or IP address of the host machine.
Server certificates must contain the Server Authentication enhanced key usage value (–eku 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1) as well as the key exchange attribute (-sky exchange).
Be sure to use a ‘CN=’ before the FQDN or IP address of the Subject for all certificates (SQL Server and LogRhythm client/server). For example: CN=LRDPX1.logrhythm.com
Ensure there are no spaces surrounding — or in between — the ‘CN’ and ‘=’ and the Subject (FQDN/Name/IP).

Work with your Administrator to get details about your organization's certificate authority and client certificates.
The setup of certificates and common access card use must be done by an authorized administrator who understands your organization's network system infrastructure and has the proficiency to set it up correctly.
Key Considerations:
When creating a server certificate for the Mediator, AIE ComMgr, and SQL Server using your ‘root’ certificate, you must run the command with the ‘-sky exchange –eku 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1’ parameter. This enables the certificate to perform Server Authentication which is required for all server certificates including those for the Mediator, AIE ComMgr, and SQL Server. If you don’t create the server certificate with the key exchange attribute specified (-sky exchange –eku 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1) it does not work for the Mediator and the certificate does not show up in the SQL Server configuration Certificates menu. The SQL Server Configuration Manager looks in both LocalMachine and CurrentUser MY stores for certificates to use.
When creating a server certificate for SQL Server using your ‘root’ certificate, you MUST use the machine FQDN for the Subject. The short hostname or IP address WILL NOT WORK.
The user the Agent service is running under MUST have the LogRhythm Root CA certificate in the LocalMachine’s trusted store (v). This allows the Agent to verify the server certificate presented by the Mediator, AIE ComMgr, and SQL Server.
The user the LogRhythm service (e.g. Agent) is running on MUST have read permissions to the certificate store and certificate(s).


Create new custom or self-signed certificates. For more information, see
Create Client and Server Certificates
. If you are using the self-signed certificates, complete the following using the existing certificates located C:\Program Files\LogRhythm\LogRhythm Common\LogRhythm API Gateway\tls.

On the Platform Manager, trust the newly generated certificates.
Add the certificate as a new file to /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/:

"This topic provides information about creating client and server certificates. Please note the following:
For SQL Server server certificates, the Subject name must be the FQDN of the host machine — IP addresses are not allowed.
For LogRhythm client and server certificates, the Subject name can be the FQDN of the host machine or its IP address.
Be sure to put a ‘CN=’ before the FQDN or IP address of the Subject for all certificates (SQL Server and LogRhythm client/server).
Ensure there are no spaces surrounding or in between the ‘CN’ and ‘=’ and the Subject (FQDN/IP).
Ensure that the client and server certificates have their signing certificate — the Root CA of the certificate — in the Trusted Root Certification Authorities store.
If the LogRhythm TrueIdentity Sync Client is on a remote host, you must generate and trust custom or self-signed certificates on the PM before continuing with configuration.
If you are using the self-signed certificates located in C:\Program Files\LogRhythm\LogRhythm Common\LogRhythm API Gateway\tls, follow instructions to trust the certificates. Note that it is recommended you create custom certificates.
The instructions below are examples using openSSL to create certifications in a Windows command prompt.
Log onto the machine where your LogRhythm Platform Manager is installed.
Go to C:\Program Files\LogRhythm\LogRhythm Infrastructure Installer\ssl, and copy the openssl.cfg to this directory.
The openssl.cfg can be found here

"The Quick Search toolbar provides an easy way to perform common analysis tasks. By default, the toolbar is located at the bottom of the Client Console window. It includes the following capabilities:
Quick lookup of the events comprising an individual alarm based on ID.
Quick lookup of an event based on ID.
Quick search based on user activity.
Quick search of host activity.
Quick search of email address activity.
You can
Run Correlate
with the Quick Search toolbar to narrow the results from Tail, Investigation, or Personal Dashboard searches.

The Quick Search toolbar performs a search based on the Search For options you select. The following is a list of those options with additional information where appropriate.
Alarm
. A record indicating that an alarm rule has been triggered by an event. Enter the id of the Alarm for which you are searching.
Classification
. LogRhythm uses classifications to group similar log messages into logical containers. These classifications provide organizations vast amounts of log data, making it easier to sort through and understand. Classifications fall under three main categories: Audit, Security, and Operations.
Common Event
. Specify the name of the event. Logs identified by Common Events matching the specified value will be searched. Wildcards are (*) allowed.
Email Address
. The value specified can exist in either the sender or recipient field.
Event
. A log having more immediate operational, security, or compliance relevance. Typically logs classified as errors, failures, or attacks are considered events.
Host
. The value specified can exist in either Origin or Impacted host fields. If the value entered is an IP address, Origin and Impacted IP is searched. If the value entered is a host name, Known Host records are searched for first. If one or more Known Hosts are found, Origin and Impacted Known Host is searched. If no Known Host is found, Origin and Impacted DNS host name is searched. Wildcards (*) allowed
Log Host
. Standard hostname given to the address of the loopback network interface. Localhost is specified where one would otherwise use the hostname of a computer.
MPE Rule.
Specify the name of the rule you are searching for. Logs matched by Message Processing Engine (MPE) Rules matching the specified value will be searched for. Wildcards (*) are allowed.
Port
. When searching for a TCP/UDP port, the value specified can exist in either the origin or impacted port field.
User
. When searching for a login, the value specified can exist in either the Login or the Account field.

"After you perform an Investigation, Log Miner, Tail, or Personal Dashboard search, you can use correlate to search those results. Correlate can narrow the original search results to display just the logs that match either a log from the original search or the values you set in the Quick Search toolbar. Because correlate only searches the logs returned in the original search, it is very efficient.
On the My LogRhythm menu, click
My Preferences
.
On the My LogRhythm menu, click
My Preferences
.
Set your Data Processor defaults.
If correlate returns the error message No log or event repositories were configured for the search, it means no Data Processor defaults are set in My Preferences.
Set your Data Processor defaults.
If correlate returns the error message No log or event repositories were configured for the search, it means no Data Processor defaults are set in My Preferences.
Generate initial search results from Investigator, Tail, Log Miner, or Personal Dashboard.

"The TopX Analysis feature provides a powerful, quickly configurable tool that offers custom views into logs and events based on metadata generated by LogRhythm. TopX allows you to select a standard metadata field (e.g., Common Event, Impacted Host, Origin Country), available metric (by count, by KBytes, by Packets), and available item (3, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, or 20) to then view the top or bottom items within the result set.
Other available functionality includes:
Viewing the data in chart and/or list format
Viewing the chart in 3D
Applying custom properties such as additional filters and a custom label
Showing the total for the Other values outside the TopX items shown
Full drill-down and one-click correlation support. For instance, double-clicking on a value in a TopX pie chart or list immediately drills down into the logs detail for that item
Contextualizing on Host, Port, or User Information
Adding Host as a Known Host

You can access TopX Analysis from within Personal Dashboard or Investigator. They are identical between the two analysis tools. The TopX Analysis widgets, along with all others, are accessible from the Tools Selector which resides as a left pane within Personal Dashboard or Investigator.
When you open Personal Dashboard or Investigator and no TopX widgets are configured, they are listed as Unconfigured TopX in the list. Twelve TopX widgets can be configured per layout. Each layout has its own set of TopX widgets. Because the Top X widgets are part of a Layout, they can also be shared as part of that layout. For details on how to manage and use them, see
Layouts
.
You can also
add values from a TopX chart to a list
and
export a whole grid from a TopX widget to a file
.

There are many use cases for TopX, but to give you an example, there are a few listed below:
Configure TopX tools to show the top 10 attackers, target hosts, target applications, and countries or origin to obtain high-level visibility into threats.
Configure TopX tools to show the top 5 hosts, applications, ports, and protocols generating network traffic.
Configure TopX tools to show the top 10 events impacting production servers as well as the top 10 least observed events. Often events seen less often are the ones to be concerned about.

Analyst Model Example
. This shows many TopX lists for an Analyst who wants to see the details.

Executive Model Example
. This shows many TopX pie charts for an Executive who just wants the big picture.

"Automatic Host Contextualization has been disabled by default for almost all log sources as of Knowledge Base 7.1.507 and Knowledge Base 6.1.507. If you have Knowledge Base synced to one of those versions, you can re-enable automatic host contextualization on a log source by creating a custom policy copy and re-enabling this feature on the rules that require it.

There are several fields that store information about hosts that are referenced within a log message:
Host (Impacted)
. The host or device impacted by log activity.
Host (Origin)
. The host or device from which log activity originated.
Interface (Impacted)
. The impacted interface number of a device or the physical port number of a switch.
Interface (Origin)
. The origin interface number of a device or the physical port number of a switch.
MAC Address (Impacted)
. The MAC address of the impacted host or device.
MAC Address (Origin)
. The MAC address of the origin host or device.
NAT IP Address (Impacted)
. The IP address from which the impacted IP was translated via NAT device logs.
NAT IP Address (Origin)
. The IP address from which the origin IP was translated via NAT device logs.
The stored value for these fields is often derived from values parsed from IP address and host name tags. For example, the value parsed for the Source IP tag is stored in Origin Host, and the value parsed for the Destination IP tag is stored in Impacted Host.
However, system logs do not consistently store the origin/source or impacted/destination values in the same respective parsing field as is often the case for network devices reporting on network flow data. These devices do not contextualize client vs. server traffic and report the server as Source IP (SIP) in one log and server as Destination IP (DIP) in another, even when it is part of the same network flow.

Based on the port values, LogRhythm can infer the relationship of the two hosts if a log contains parsed values for the following fields:
SIP/SName
DIP/DName
Source Port (SPort)
Destination Port (DPort)
Port values can reliably determine which system is running a server process (impacted host/DIP/DName) vs. the system connecting to that server process (origin host/SIP/SName). This is performed by referring to IANA port allocation rules combined with internal known port lookup tables.

The process LogRhythm uses to evaluate port numbers to determine whether it is an origin host or impacted host is to check to see if values parsed for SPort and DPort are a mapping port:
If both SPort and DPort are mapping ports, infer via IANA logic.
If one value is a mapping port, host associated with mapped port = impacted host.
IANA Inference Logic
If value parsed for DPort <= 1023 AND value parsed for SPort > 1023Impacted host or port = parsed DPort host or port values
If value parsed for SPort <= 1023 AND value parsed for DPort > 1023Impacted host or port = parsed SPort host or port values
If value parsed for DPort (>= 1024 AND <= 49151) AND value parsed for SPort > 49151Impacted host or port = parsed DPort host or port values
If value parsed for SPort (>= 1024 AND <= 49151) AND value parsed for DPort > 49151Impacted host or port = parsed SPort host or port values
Else, Impacted host or port = parsed DPort host or port values

Automatic Host Contextualization is performed only if all the following are true:
The log has parsed values for Origin Host, Impacted Host, Origin Port, and Impacted Port.
The host context is set Tags Normal or Tags Reversed.
The service context is set to Tags Normal or Tags Reversed.

One of the key reasons to contextualize a host or service automatically is to improve the aggregation of log data for unique IP and port combinations. Currently, network data can be aggregated on the following fields:
Origin Host
Impacted Host
Origin Port (disabled by default LogMartMode)
Impacted Port
Protocol
ServiceId
If the Impacted Port is the origin port and, as a result, is random in nature, aggregation is much less effective and LogMart utilization is reduced.
As a solution, whenever Automatic Host Contextualization is performed, LogMart is updated according to the following rules:
Origin Port is set to Null regardless LogMartMode setting.
The parsed value for Impacted Port is saved if any of the following conditions are true:
Impacted port is determined via Port Mapping.
Impacted port is determined via IANA algorithm.
Impacted port is determined via Port Mapping.
Impacted port is determined via IANA algorithm.
If none of the above are true:
Impacted Port is set to NULL.
ServiceId is set to one of the following three values:
Unknown UDP
Unknown TCP
Unknown
This value is also set for the associated log and event.
Impacted Port is set to NULL.
ServiceId is set to one of the following three values:
Unknown UDP
Unknown TCP
Unknown
Unknown UDP
Unknown TCP
Unknown
This value is also set for the associated log and event.

Because bytes in/out and items in/out always pertain to the value stored for impacted host, the values parsed must be set accordingly. Therefore, if host context is determined to be reversed (what was parsed for SIP/SName is stored as DIP/DName), the values parsed for bytes in/out and items in/out are also reversed.

"Network records identify and logically group a range of IP addresses to:
Assign a Risk-Based Priority (RBP) to events.
Determine direction such as inbound or outbound for the activity being logged.
Network records do not need to correspond to physical networks. Their function is to identify a contiguous range of IP addresses that share a common risk threshold. For direction identification, all undefined network ranges are considered to be external in nature; although for risk rating, networks may also be defined explicitly as external.

In LogRhythm, Known Networks are used:
To help calculate Risk Based Priority (RBP) and Direction.
As criteria for Alarm Rules.
MPE resolves the Network at run-time when it calculates RBP and direction. The Alarm and Response Manager (ARM) resolves the network at run time for rules evaluation.

Hosts and Networks are also assigned a Zone value of Internal, External, or DMZ. The Zone is assigned in the order:
Zone of the resolved Known Host.
Zone of the resolved Network.
The IP address:
If the IP Address is private, set the Zone to Internal.
If the IP Address is public, set the Zone to External.
If there is no IP Address, set the Zone to Unknown.
If the IP Address is private, set the Zone to Internal.
If the IP Address is public, set the Zone to External.
If there is no IP Address, set the Zone to Unknown.

"LogRhythm Administrators want an easy and streamlined workflow to onboard and manage Open Collector. LogRhythm SIEM 7.14 brings this functionality to the Web Console!
Integrate Open Collector with the SIEM
and use the Web Console to deploy
Beats and collect their log sources
.
With this complete workflow all contained within the Web Console, security teams can now focus more on security and less on configuration. In this release the following Beats can be on-boarded and managed directly within the Web Console, cutting administration time in half.

The LogRhythm SIEM’s new
Resource Center
offers Analysts quick access to important LogRhythm resources like Community, Documentation and Support. Additionally, the Onboarding section gives new users in-app tutorials to help them get comfortable with the LogRhythm Web Console. And finally, the Announcements section will be introduced in the Resource Center so customers are aware of the latest updates and critical information from LogRhythm.
The example guide teaches users how to use LogRhythm SIEM without having to leave the Web Console.

As LogRhythm Axon’s popularity increases, we want to make migration easier for customers switching to Axon. LogRhythm SIEM 7.14 gives users the power to
forward a copy of their logs to Axon
. Customers can easily do a proof of concept in Axon while still maintaining their current LogRhythm SIEM deployment. For customers who choose to migrate to Axon, onboarding to the new platform will be a smooth transition. While Axon has its own Agent, this speeds up the ability to get logs into Axon by sending logs to both the Data Processor and Axon. Previously only available in limited situations, now all customers can leverage both platforms!
The Axon Settings tab of the System Monitor Agent Properties makes it easy to start forwarding logs to your Axon tenant.

With the introduction of the
Deployment Statistics
, LogRhythm Cloud customers can now get more insight on their deployment. Quickly access important information such as current MPS, average log size, and details regarding archives (if applicable).

Description
ENG-40105
Databases
The database install tool now correctly installs SQL Standard as opposed to SQL Enterprise.
To resolve this issue, the installer for 7.13 has been updated to include SQL Standard edition rather than SQL Enterprise. Unless you are a user of LogRhythm Disaster Recovery solutions, using SQL Enterprise has no negative effect on your deployment and no further action needs to be taken. If you use (or plan to use) LogRhythm Disaster Recovery solutions, please see the section below,
Disaster Recovery SQL Downgrades
.

Issue ENG-40105 only impacts users of LogRhythm Disaster Recovery solutions. If you use (or plan to use) LogRhythm Disaster Recovery, your SQL server needs to be manually downgraded from Enterprise to Standard. We recommend that this process be performed by LogRhythm Customer Support or Professional Services.
For information on contacting LogRhythm Support, refer to the
LogRhythm Customer Support Guide

To resolve issue ENG-38290, your LogRhythm database must be upgraded. If you are a user of the Log Volume Report and need this issue to be resolved in your environment, you must take this step as well.
For instructions on how to run the LogRhythm Database Upgrade tool, refer to the topic
Upgrade LogRhythm Databases
.
To avoid running the entire Database Upgrade tool, you can simply execute the Logrhythm.LogMart.sql file manually. Updating LogMart alone is sufficient to resolve the issue with the Log Volume Report.

Customers want to retain their data, and they need an easy way to find their older data. With LogRhythm 7.13, customers who use our self-hosted SIEM option now have access to SecondLook. After installing and configuring SecondLook, customers can query data and search through archives directly from the Web Console. Without having to pivot between the Web Console and Client Console, customers save valuable time. Using SecondLook also means searches are passed off to a dedicated service for a more reliable user experience.
Initiating a SecondLook search.
For installation and configuration details, see
Install SecondLook API
.

With new features, come new REST API endpoints! LogRhythm 7.13 further extends the automation capabilities of the Admin API so that you can programmatically:
Configure, update, and retrieve System Monitor DP Pooling settings.

Data Processor pooling makes it easy for administrators to distribute log volume across a pool of Data Processors and create well-balanced Data Indexer clusters. With DP pooling, administrators can quickly define DP pools and assign Agents to them. Agents then auto-distribute their logs across the DP pool. Administrators can also turn off DP pooling by switching an Agent to pinned mode.
System Monitor Agents are the workhorses that collect and ship data to Data Processors. But there was not a good way to load balance these System Monitor Agents across multiple Data Processors — until now.
With version 7.13, LogRhythm introduces
Data Processor Pooling
, a new feature that lets administrators define a pool of one or more Data Processors to allow a single Agent to collectively send its data to a group of Data Processors. When an Agent is assigned a DP pool, the Agent will spread the logs across the Data Processors. This removes the need to manually review Agent volumes and adjust which Data Processors the Agents are sending to, saving you time.
Defining a Data Processor pool.

Assigning a Data Processor to a pool.

Assigning a System Monitor to a pool.

The 7.13 System Monitor is now embedded with a native JSON parsing engine. This significantly improves processing performance and removes the need to work with JQ query language. With the new architecture, Beats can be rerouted from the Open Collector parsing engine to the new parsing engine on the System Monitor. This simplifies sizing, deployment, and troubleshooting of the platform. For more information, see
Configure Beats for JSON Parsing
.
Enabling JSON parsing on a System Monitor Agent.

In the Web Console, global and restricted administrators now have an Agents option in the Administration menu.
On the Agents page, administrators can quickly check the status and health of System Monitors right in the Web Console. They can easily see a System Monitor's status and the timestamp of the last heartbeat received.
The
Agents Grid
shows a dynamic display of agents based on the access granted to the user.
Restricted administrators can only view the effective System Monitors defined in their user profile.
The Agents Grid helps administrators immediately identify problematic Agents with Last Heartbeat highlighting. In environments that contain thousands of Agents, admins can filter down to view just the Agents that matter. Filters include:
Name
Name
Host
Host
Entity

Type
Type
Number of Log Source

Over time, operating systems become outdated, making past versions unsupported. With the release of 7.13, LogRhythm is supporting and installing Microsoft Server 2022, Microsoft SQL Server 2019, and Rocky Linux. For customers that prefer the open-source version of Linux, Data Indexers and Open Collector support Rocky Linux 9 and RHEL 9. For customers with RHEL licenses, LogRhythm SIEM supports RHEL 9. For information, see the Component Operating System Support section in
Review the Requirements for a New LogRhythm Deployment
.
We’ve also added additional support for System Monitor, which includes Windows 2022, Windows 11, Rocky Linux 9, and RHEL 9. For information, see

Version
The SIEM version associated with the Agent.
Status
Indicates whether the Agent is Active or Retired.
Data Processor
The highest-priority data processor to which the Agent forwards logs, as configured in
Modify System Monitor Basic Properties
.
Last Heartbeat
Indicates the date and time of the most recent heartbeat received for the Agent.
A yellow background highlights Agents in a Warning status, and a red background highlights those in Error status, as configured in
System Monitor Basic Properties
.
An Agent progresses to Warning status once one heartbeat interval is missed and will progress to Error status after a second complete heartbeat interval has been missed.

Each column can be filtered using the filter options below the column name. There are three filter types in the Agents grid:
Filter Type
Description
Text

"In the last release, LR SIEM 7.11, LogRhythm introduced
SecondLook
in the Web Console for LogRhythm Cloud customers who purchased archive storage. This new SecondLook UI lets LogRhythm Cloud customers configure and run SecondLook restores directly from the Web Console. In 7.12, we added a quick search function that allows users to retrieve completed SecondLook restore results with the click of a button.
An inactive search icon is now displayed in the actions column of each restore. When the restore status moves from In Progress to Completed, the icon activates.


Select the icon to quickly run a search for the logs restored by SecondLook.


Each search is pre-populated with the filter criteria used in the corresponding saved SecondLook restore settings, and it works like all other searches. T
he history of past searches is updated whenever you click the SecondLook quick search icon, giving you easy access to modify pre-populated filters.


Over the past several SIEM versions, LogRhythm has released additional endpoints for the Admin API that enable integration and automation workflows for log source and agent onboarding. Version 7.12 further extends these capabilities by adding endpoints that allow you to programmatically:
Retrieve additional log source details, including:
Last Log Message
Silent Log Source configurations
System Monitor name
System Monitor ID
Last Log Message
Silent Log Source configurations
System Monitor name
System Monitor ID
Create and update virtual log sources from a template
Update existing log source virtualization templates
Manage log processing policies
Manage log source types
For more details on all the available endpoints, refer to the
API Documentation
. New to the API and wondering how to get started? Learn more on the
Community
!

Version 7.12 improves log source onboarding workflows with log source visibility in the Web Console and enhancements to the Open Collector's
OC Admin
.

Collecting data from API log sources is faster and easier with OC Admin. In 7.12, we added support to the following LogRhythm Beats:
Prisma
Symantec Web Secure Service (WSS)
Microsoft Graph API
Carbon Black Cloud
Cisco AMP
DUO
Proofpoint

Monitoring collectors across the enterprise just became easier. LogRhythm SIEM 7.12 introduces light administration capabilities within OC Admin.
Live statistics (CPU, memory, network, storage, and processes consumption) are available for the containers running on a given Open Collector host.

On the Open Collector Manage page, customers can perform a series of actions on the Beats and Open Collector components, including: starting and stopping, importing and exporting configurations, exporting logs as files, and viewing high-level configurations or real time logs in the UI.


Finally, we added support for exporting and tracking Open Collector and Beats internal logs in real time.


In the Web Console, global and restricted administrators now have a Log Sources option in the Administration menu.
On the Log Sources page, administrators can quickly check the status and health of log sources in the Web Console. They can easily see if a log source is active or retired, along with the timestamp of the last log received.
The
Log Source Grid
shows a dynamic display of log sources based on the access granted to the user.
The Log Source Grid helps administrators immediately identify problematic log sources with Silent Log Source highlighting. In environments that contain thousands of log sources, admins can filter down to view just the log sources that matter. Filters include:
Name
Entity
Log Source Type
Log Source Host
Collection Agent
Silent Log Source status
Last Log Message
Name
Entity
Log Source Type
Log Source Host
Collection Agent
Silent Log Source status
Last Log Message


For LogRhythm Cloud customers, role-based access controls now provide more granular options for allowing access to
SecondLook
. Within a user profile, administrators can grant a user access to the SecondLook tool in the Client Console, in the Web Console, or in both consoles.


Upgrade considerations for all 7.12.x releases are available on the
LogRhythm Release Notes
main page.
LogRhythm 7.9.0 introduced support for Microsoft SQL Server 2019 and Windows Server 2019 on standard deployments.
If your deployment is running SQL Server 2016 Standard or Windows Server 2016, there is no need to upgrade to
2019
.

"Enhanced Auditing is a shadow table with a system of triggers and tables that can be implemented to track all database table inserts, updates, and deletions. The system captures the name of the user, the type of update, the date and time of the update, and changes to the data in each record. Auditing is done at the record level.
LogRhythm Enhanced Auditing is enabled and supported by default for a particular group of tables that monitor administrative actions in LogRhythm.  A setup to collect data from each shadow table to log the audit information directly into the SIEM must be established. Users can create dashboards, reports, and alarms around LogRhythm Administrative actions with the data collected from shadow tables.

Description
Release Notes
Expected Results
: Poorly written AIE Rules should be suspended until they are altered and re-enabled.
Workaround
: Rewrite the AIE Rule for better performance. Often, this involves adding filters, reducing log sources, and modifying the logic. Tuning an AIE Rule requires expertise, so contact LogRhythm Training, Professional Services, or a Sales Engineer to assist if necessary. Additional solutions to identify and monitor poorly performing rules are being developed for a future release.
Expected Results
: These errors should not be generated in the AIE Engine log, but AIE is working and alarms are firing.
Workaround
: There is currently no workaround for this issue.
Expected Results
: AIE Rule Blocks should fire when they are triggered at the same time.
Workaround
: As the behavior of simultaneous events is unpredictable and the use case for a 0-time interval is rare, LogRhythm does not plan to change this behavior at this time. To avoid the issue, set the evaluation period to 1 second.
Expected Results
: The date and time of the AIE Event should not have a future time.
Workaround
: There is no workaround for this issue.
Expected Results
: AIE Rules should not fire if the rule block relationship is not met.
Workaround
: Change the Host (origin) or Host (impacted) fields to IP Address, and the AIE Rule works as expected.
Expected Results
: Logs in this directory should be purged after the number of days defined for expiration has passed, defaulted to 7 days.
Workaround
:  Manually remove these files to prevent the C drive from filling up.
Expected Results:
Should be able to define an AIE rule's date and time using the UTC time zone.
Workaround:
There is currently no workaround for this issue.
Expected Results
: Alarms should not fire if a log is received for a Not Observed block.
Workaround
: While there is currently no workaround, LogRhythm is investigating this issue for a future release.
Expected Results
: Alarms should execute quickly as expected with other AIE Alarms.
Workaround
: There is currently no workaround for this issue.
Expected Results
: The AIE Engine should trigger alarms for Log Not Observed.
Workaround
: There is currently no workaround for this issue.
DE14530
DE14531
Expected Results:
Input normalization for MAC Addresses, requiring them to be entered in the accepted format.
Workaround:
Use data masking rules to transform the MAC addresses to the colon delimited format.
Expected Results
: Web Services does not need to be restarted to have a rule group change show up.
Workaround
: Restart Web Services.
Expected Results
: The Alarming and Response Manager should able to send alarm notifications using any SMTP server and SSL authentication.
Workaround
: There is currently no workaround for this issue.
Expected Results
: The Alarming and Response Manager should be aware of a change of status of the SRPs and should not continue to attempt to execute them.
Workaround
: Lower the logging level on the ARM to help mitigate this, but contact LogRhythm Technical Support if assistance is needed to retire the SRP.
Expected Results:
Recent alarms should be visible when searching in the client console.
Workaround:
There is currently no workaround for this issue.
Expected Results
: Case API and Admin API should start when using any size certificate.
Workaround
: Remove the server from the domain and reboot it. Verify that the 512-bit certificate has been removed, re-run the installers, and reboot. To avoid this issue, do not join the domain again or the certificate will be pushed out again. In addition, create a new certificate that uses a 384-bit (or less) hash or exclude the impacted system from the GPO that pushes the certificate.
Expected Results
: When the Admin API log generates errors, it should provide some context within the error message.
Workaround
: There is currently no workaround for this issue.
Expected Results
: The extra semicolon, which is an optional valid separator in a content-type header, should not prevent scripts from working upon upgrade.
Workaround
:
While there is currently no workaround, LogRhythm is investigating this issue for a future release
.
Expected Results:
The Log Level should be changed by updating the Log Level in Configuration Manager.
Workaround
: There is currently no workaround for this issue.
Expected Results
: Entities should be retireable and able to be hidden from view.
Workaround
: Contact Technical Support to assist you in removing entities that are no longer needed.
Expected Results
: When exporting reports in .csv format, the column headers should not be repeated on each row.
Workaround
: The report needs to be formatted to remove columns that show the column headers. In addition, LogRhythm data can be exported using Log Distribution Services (LDS).
Expected Results
: The processing of a log should be the same whether it is parsed in Rule Builder or MPE.
Workaround
: Change the sub-rule to use a different tag, such as <Tag1>. If you are experiencing this issue, ensure that you are not using a custom Log Processing Policy and that there are no MPE timeouts. If issues persist, contact Technical Support and reference this bug number (DE1829) or its sister defect (DE1651).
Expected Results
: When a search times out, a message should inform users and instruct them to re-run the search with a longer timeout.
Workaround
: Increase the timeout on the query and re-run it.
Expected Results
: All chosen fields should appear on the report if they contain data.
Workaround
: Running the report as an investigation yields the expected results in the Network (Impacted) column. LogRhythm is actively working on a solution to this issue in a future release.
Expected Results
: Identity data should appear in reports that contain those fields.
Workaround
: Run an investigation to provide the same information.
Expected Results
: Disabling Log Source Virtualization should not change the behavior of the System Monitor.
Workaround
: This issue is caused by the scsm.ini file not being updated immediately. To work around it, refresh the Log Sources tab in the Client Console to force the .ini file to refresh.
Expected Results
:  Second Look restore should run without issues.
Workaround
:  There is currently no workaround for this issue.
Expected Results:
Reports should all display in the local time zone or that specified in the report configuration.
Workaround
:  There is currently no workaround for this issue.

Workaround
: Export selected logs instead of all logs to allow the export to complete.
Expected Results
: The hostname should be displayed the same for both Web and Client Consoles.
Workaround
: View the record in the Web Console.
Expected Results
: When right-clicking the Unconfigured TopX section in the investigation results, a menu appears to allow for configuration of results.
Workaround
: Utilize the Web Console to view results in a widget-type format.
Expected Results
: Users that are moved between Active Directory groups should update upon the move.
Workaround
: There is no workaround for this issue other than manually updating the profiles.

Workaround
: Go into the User Profile Manager and grant access to the newly imported SmartResponse Plugin.
Expected Results
: The entity delete functionality works without any issues.
Workaround:
There is currently no workaround for this issue.
Expected Results
: When custom settings are selected, they should persist through a Knowledge Base update.
Workaround
: Reselect the Log Source Type settings prior to doing a Windows Host Wizard scan.
Duplicate Active Directory groups and users are being created because OU filters are not being used when scanning domains.
Expected Results
: No duplicate entries should be created.
Workaround
: There is currently no workaround for this issue.
DE12489
Expected Results
: Alarms should continue to trigger and be displayed in the Web Console.
Workaround
: Contact Technical Support for assistance, as there could be many reasons for this behavior beyond this defect. Support will help determine the root cause.
Expected Results
: The non-paged pool should not increase and cause system performance issues.
Workaround
: Restart the LogRhythm API Gateway service.
Expected Results

Workaround
: For assistance with this workaround, contact LogRhythm Technical Support.
Expected Results
: The Data Indexer should be removed and re-added instead of adding a second instance.
Workaround
: Uninstall both versions of the Data Indexer, ensure there or no hung .msi processes in the Task Manager, then re-install the 7.6.0 Hotfix 2 version.
Expected Results
: The Carpenter service should not cause port exhaustion.
Workaround
: Create a scheduled task to restart the Carpenter service each day.
Expected Results
: The Transporter should continue to run after a restart signal is sent.
Workaround
: Restart the Transporter service.

: There is currently no workaround for this issue.
DE260
DE9367
Expected Results
: SQL deadlock issues should not cause a missed heartbeat.
Workaround
: While there is no known workaround, LogRhythm is actively investigating this issue for a solution.
Expected Results
: Transaction logs should be truncated by frequent scheduled backups throughout the day.
Workaround
: There is currently no workaround for this issue.
Expected Results
: Scheduled reports should not be sent to disabled accounts.
Workaround
: There is currently no workaround for this issue.
Expected Results
: The Client Console should provide an alternate way to retrieve the data if Crystal Reports is not able to render it.
Workaround
: Decrease the amount of data the report is trying to retrieve or export the data instead.
Expected Results
: Searching against warm indices should return results whether the results are in hot or warm nodes.
Workaround

Workaround
: Export the report in another format or remove the extra lines from the .csv.
Expected Results
: When a disabled user is re-enabled, the user's login should also be enabled during the next AD Synchronization.
Workaround
: Manually enable the user's login after the AD sync.
Expected Results
: The report should show the accurate last backup time for each database.
Workaround
: Review the backup information in SQL Server Management Studio.
Expected Results
: Archives should process, seal, and move out of the Unprocessed Archives folder as long as the processing rate is at or below the system specification.
Workaround
: Evaluate system sizing and consider an expansion to meet active load demands. In some systems, increasing the ArchiveSize setting in the Data Processor Advanced Properties to 51200 (from the default value of 10240) can help process archive files faster. If necessary, move large files out of the Unprocessed Archives folder to another drive and slowly feed them back in when the system is successfully processing the live data. A more permanent solution to this issue will be provided in a future release.
Expected Results
: The AIE Data Provider service should start consistently and as expected. Failures should be consistently logged to alert when the service did not start correctly.
Workaround
: Restart the Mediator service to allow the AIE Data Provider service to start. A more permanent solution to this issue is being evaluated for a future release.
Expected Results
: The Mediator continues to process and move archive files to inactive when the connection is restored.
Workaround
: Ensure that the account the Mediator service is running has permission to access the network location.
In certain circumstances when Entity Archive settings are turned on, customers may receive the following error:
**ERROR** Failed to locate or create inactive subdirectory: The given key was not present in the dictionary.. Inactive archive files will be temporarily stored at the root of the system drive (C:\ in most cases). This error must be corrected in order for inactive archives to be stored at the specified location.
Expected Results
: Entity archiving should function without errors.
Workaround
: There is currently no workaround for this issue.
Expected results
: The Mediator should only attempt to seal the archive file once.
Workaround
: There is no workaround for this issue.
Expected Results:
Datadog's telemetry metrics parsing errors should not be present in the metrics collection file.
Workaround:
There is currently no workaround for this issue.
Expected Results
:  The SmartResponse Plugin should execute after selecting the System Monitor Agent.
Workaround
:
There is currently no workaround for this issue
.
Expected Results
: Grouping values in SmartResponse Plugins should be allowed.
Workaround
: There is no workaround for this issue.
Expected Results
: SmartResponse Plugins should fire each time the AIE Rule is triggered.
Workaround
: There is no workaround for this issue.

Expected Results
: White space should be allowed in the OU/DC filter.
Workaround
: While there is no workaround for this issue, LogRhythm is investigating a resolution for a future release.
Expected Results
: The TrueIdentity Sync Client should work for any number of users.
Workaround
: While there is no workaround for this issue, the next release of the Sync Client will be able to support larger AD environments.
Expected Results
: When users try to download a PCAP that is no longer available on disk, the error message should provide that detail instead of an unclassified failure.
Workaround
: The error message will be changed in a future release. There are two simple troubleshooting steps to identify if the PCAP exists or if other issues are occurring in the integration: Log in to NetMon directly and verify if the selected PCAP has already aged out or should be available on disk. Recreate the API key for the selected NetMon and update the NetMon configuration in the Deployment Manager.
Expected Results
: When copying widgets, all settings should remain.
Workaround
: Users can add a new widget to the dashboard and configure it manually to work around this issue. This issue is still being actively investigated and will be resolved in a future release.
Expected Results
: All data contained in the .csv export should be valid and match the data displayed in the Web Console.
Workaround
: Export the same investigation from the Client Console or manually adjust the first and last date post export. LogRhythm is investigating a solution to this issue.
Expected Results
: Users should be able to scroll through all TrueIdentity records in the Web Console.
Workaround
: Using filters to find specific data in the TrueIdentity page prevents the error message from showing and helps find data more quickly. LogRhythm is working on a resolution for a future release.
Expected Results
: The Web Console should not time out when downloading large PCAP files.
Workaround
: Change the time out setting in the Configuration Manager.

Expected Results
: The Download PCAP button should appear when reviewing NetMon logs.
Workaround
: Reload the frame with the Download PCAP button to activate it.
Expected Results
: The Node-Link Graph should function regardless of the browser zoom level.
Workaround
:  Return the browser to 100% zoom and refresh the Web Console.
Expected Results
: The Analyze Dashboard filter should reset.
Workaround
: In User Settings set the Drilldown setting to Open in Page.
Expected Results
: Drilling into data on a dashboard should not change the dashboard filter criteria.
Workaround
: Reapply the dashboard filter.
Expected Results
: After closing a previous drilldown tab, the next drill down into a widget item should not show the older filters.
Workaround
: After drilling in a filter, refresh the web page. The next drill down into a widget item uses the correct filter.
Expected Results
: The Analyzer grid should not update with new events when paused.
Workaround
: There is currently no workaround for this issue.
Expected Results
: drill down results should not be hidden.
Workaround
: Select Default Analyze Dashboard
Expected Results
: Event data should appear in the dashboard.

: There is currently no workaround for this issue.
Expected Results
: The search and drill down operations should return results upon completion or terminate.
Workaround
: Reload the page.
Expected Results:
The Timeline View widget works as normal.
Workaround:
There is currently no workaround for this issue.
Expected Results
: The checked count should reset.
Workaround
: After performing an action, select the Uncheck All option to reset the checked count.
Expected Results
: The search and drill down operations should return results upon completion or terminate.
Workaround
: Reload the page.
Expected Results
: Searching for terms should yield results for exact matches and not 'AND' the words separated by hyphens.
Workaround
: There is currently no workaround for this issue.
Expected Results
:  Lucene filtering should only apply to the widget from which it originated, Other widgets on the page will still lack the drilldown or time slice,
Workaround
: There is currently no workaround for this issue.
Expected Results

"LogRhythm 7.9.0 introduces support for Microsoft SQL Server 2019 and Windows Server 2019 on standard deployments.
If your deployment is running SQL Server 2016 Standard or Windows Server 2016, there is no need to upgrade to
2019
.
For more information on the optional upgrades, see:
Upgrade SQL Server 2016 to SQL Server 2019
Upgrade Windows Server 2016 to Windows Server 2019
L
ogRhythm 7.9.0 does not support upgrades to
Microsoft SQL Server 2019 and Windows Server 2019 on existing High Availability (HA) and Disaster Recovery (DR) environments.
SQL Server 2019 Licensing
If you
purchased hardware through LogRhythm and wish to upgrade SQL, you must provide your own SQL 2019 installer and license.
Software-only purchases allow customers to either bring their own SQL license or purchase one through LogRhythm. See the table below to determine whether your software purchase includes a SQL 2019 license.
Windows Server 2019 Licensing
If you
purchased hardware from
LogRhythm
on or after Nov
.
1, 2020
, you
purchased a Server 2019 from
LogRhythm
. This license can be used to upgrade the operating system.
You
can use and validate
your
license by looking at the license sticker on top of the server. If
you are
unable to locate the license,
you
can
open a support case
.
If you purchased
hardware prior to Nov
.
1, 2020
, you
must
provide
your
own Server 2019 license
to upgrade
.

Explanation:
The License Information Report now shows the 24-hour average MPS for each Data Processor. The License Metering Report was added to the bottom of the License Information Report. This shows the 24-hour moving average over the last 30 days, making licensing overages more visible and easier to understand.
Benefit:
These two updates improve the accuracy and readability of MPS rates and improve users' ability to manage their license usage and lower expenses.
Relevant Documentation Updates:
Assign LogRhythm Licenses

Security-related issues resolved with this release are available for customers to view on the
Community
.

The following issues have each been found and reported by multiple users.
Expected Results
: Searching System Monitor Agent Properties log sources should return all log sources from the current agent.
Workaround
: There is currently no workaround for this issue.
Expected Results
: Poorly written AIE Rules should be suspended until they are altered and re-enabled.
Workaround
: Rewrite the AIE Rule for better performance. Often, this involves adding filters, reducing log sources, and modifying the logic. Tuning an AIE Rule requires expertise, so contact LogRhythm Training, Professional Services, or a Sales Engineer to assist if necessary. Additional solutions to identify and monitor poorly performing rules are being developed for a future release.
Expected Results
: These errors should not be generated in the AIE Engine log, but AIE is working and alarms are firing.
Workaround
: There is currently no workaround for this issue.
Expected Results
: AIE Rule Blocks should fire when they are triggered at the same time.
Workaround
: As the behavior of simultaneous events is unpredictable and the use case for a 0-time interval is rare, LogRhythm does not plan to change this behavior at this time. To avoid the issue, set the evaluation period to 1 second.
Expected Results
: The date and time of the AIE Event should not have a future time.
Workaround
: There is no workaround for this issue.
Expected Results
: AIE Rules should not fire if the rule block relationship is not met.
Workaround
: Change the Host (origin) or Host (impacted) fields to IP Address, and the AIE Rule works as expected.
Expected Results
: AIE Summary Fields should be displayed on all AIE Notification emails.
Workaround
: View the AIE Summary Fields in the Alarm instead of the Notification email.
Expected Results
: Logs in this directory should be purged after the number of days defined for expiration has passed, defaulted to 7 days.
Workaround
:  Manually remove these files to prevent the C drive from filling up.
Expected Results
: Alarms should not fire if a log is received for a Not Observed block.
Workaround
: While there is currently no workaround, LogRhythm is investigating this issue for a future release.
Expected Results
: AIE Rules should fire as expected.
Workaround
:
While there is currently no workaround, LogRhythm is investigating this issue for a future release
.
Expected Results
: Alarms should execute quickly as expected with other AIE Alarms.
Workaround
: There is currently no workaround for this issue.
Expected Results
: The AIE Engine should trigger alarms for Log Not Observed.
Workaround
: There is currently no workaround for this issue.
DE14530
DE14531
Expected Results:
Input normalization for MAC Addresses, requiring them to be entered in the accepted format.
Workaround:
Use data masking rules to transform the MAC addresses to the colon delimited format.
Expected Results
: Web Services does not need to be restarted to have a rule group change show up.
Workaround
: Restart Web Services.
Expected Results
: The Alarming and Response Manager should able to send alarm notifications using any SMTP server and SSL authentication.
Workaround
: There is currently no workaround for this issue.
Expected Results
: The Alarming and Response Manager should be aware of a change of status of the SRPs and should not continue to attempt to execute them.
Workaround
: Lower the logging level on the ARM to help mitigate this, but contact LogRhythm Technical Support if assistance is needed to retire the SRP.
Expected Results
: Case API and Admin API should start when using any size certificate.
Workaround
: Remove the server from the domain and reboot it. Verify that the 512-bit certificate has been removed, re-run the installers, and reboot. To avoid this issue, do not join the domain again or the certificate will be pushed out again. In addition, create a new certificate that uses a 384-bit (or less) hash or exclude the impacted system from the GPO that pushes the certificate.
Expected Results
: When the Admin API log generates errors, it should provide some context within the error message.
Workaround
: There is currently no workaround for this issue.
Expected Results
: The extra semicolon, which is an optional valid separator in a content-type header, should not prevent scripts from working upon upgrade.
Workaround
:
While there is currently no workaround, LogRhythm is investigating this issue for a future release
.
Expected Results
: Entities should be retireable and able to be hidden from view.
Workaround
: Contact Technical Support to assist you in removing entities that are no longer needed.
Expected Results
: When exporting reports in .csv format, the column headers should not be repeated on each row.
Workaround
: The report needs to be formatted to remove columns that show the column headers. In addition, LogRhythm data can be exported using Log Distribution Services (LDS).
Expected Results
: The processing of a log should be the same whether it is parsed in Rule Builder or MPE.
Workaround
: Change the sub-rule to use a different tag, such as <Tag1>. If you are experiencing this issue, ensure that you are not using a custom Log Processing Policy and that there are no MPE timeouts. If issues persist, contact Technical Support and reference this bug number (DE1829) or its sister defect (DE1651).
Expected Results
: When a search times out, a message should inform users and instruct them to re-run the search with a longer timeout.
Workaround
: Increase the timeout on the query and re-run it.
Expected Results
: All chosen fields should appear on the report if they contain data.
Workaround
: Running the report as an investigation yields the expected results in the Network (Impacted) column. LogRhythm is actively working on a solution to this issue in a future release.
Expected Results
: Identity data should appear in reports that contain those fields.
Workaround
: Run an investigation to provide the same information.
Expected Results
: Disabling Log Source Virtualization should not change the behavior of the System Monitor.
Workaround
: This issue is caused by the scsm.ini file not being updated immediately. To work around it, refresh the Log Sources tab in the Client Console to force the .ini file to refresh.
Expected Results
:  Second Look restore should run without issues.
Workaround
:  There is currently no workaround for this issue.
Expected Results:
Reports should all display in the local time zone or that specified in the report configuration.
Workaround
:  There is currently no workaround for this issue.
Expected Results
: When editing a report template, existing fields should remain unless they are explicitly removed.
Workaround
: When editing a report template that contains the Normal Date field, add that field back to the template prior to saving it.
Expected Results
: The Console should not freeze when exporting logs.
Workaround
: Export selected logs instead of all logs to allow the export to complete.
Expected Results
: The hostname should be displayed the same for both Web and Client Consoles.
Workaround
: View the record in the Web Console.
Expected Results
: Users that are moved between Active Directory groups should update upon the move.
Workaround
: There is no workaround for this issue other than manually updating the profiles.
Expected Results
: Users should be able to filter out the retired log sources when filtering by Log Source Type.
Workaround
:  Use the Include Retired box or use another method of filtering.

Expected Results
: When custom settings are selected, they should persist through a Knowledge Base update.
Workaround
: Reselect the Log Source Type settings prior to doing a Windows Host Wizard scan.
Duplicate Active Directory groups and users are being created because OU filters are not being used when scanning domains.
Expected Results
: No duplicate entries should be created.
Workaround
: There is currently no workaround for this issue.
DE12489
Expected Results
: Alarms should continue to trigger and be displayed in the Web Console.

DE260
DE9367
Expected Results
: SQL deadlock issues should not cause a missed heartbeat.
Workaround
: While there is no known workaround, LogRhythm is actively investigating this issue for a solution.
Expected Results
: Scheduled reports should not be sent to disabled accounts.
Workaround
: There is currently no workaround for this issue.
Expected Results
: The Client Console should provide an alternate way to retrieve the data if Crystal Reports is not able to render it.
Workaround
: Decrease the amount of data the report is trying to retrieve or export the data instead.
Expected Results
: The Job Manager should generate a message stating that the results were not complete and the report should indicate partial results.
Workaround
: There is currently no workaround for this issue.
Expected Results
: Exported reports should not duplicate header and footer lines.
Workaround
: Export the report in another format or remove the extra lines from the .csv.
Expected Results
: When a disabled user is re-enabled, the user's login should also be enabled during the next AD Synchronization.
Workaround
: Manually enable the user's login after the AD sync.
Expected Results
: The report should show the accurate last backup time for each database.
Workaround
: Review the backup information in SQL Server Management Studio.
Expected Results
: Archives should process, seal, and move out of the Unprocessed Archives folder as long as the processing rate is at or below the system specification.
Workaround
: Evaluate system sizing and consider an expansion to meet active load demands. In some systems, increasing the ArchiveSize setting in the Data Processor Advanced Properties to 51200 (from the default value of 10240) can help process archive files faster. If necessary, move large files out of the Unprocessed Archives folder to another drive and slowly feed them back in when the system is successfully processing the live data. A more permanent solution to this issue will be provided in a future release.
Expected Results
: The AIE Data Provider service should start consistently and as expected. Failures should be consistently logged to alert when the service did not start correctly.
Workaround
: Restart the Mediator service to allow the AIE Data Provider service to start. A more permanent solution to this issue is being evaluated for a future release.
In certain circumstances when Entity Archive settings are turned on, customers may receive the following error:
**ERROR** Failed to locate or create inactive subdirectory: The given key was not present in the dictionary.. Inactive archive files will be temporarily stored at the root of the system drive (C:\ in most cases). This error must be corrected in order for inactive archives to be stored at the specified location.
Expected Results
: Entity archiving should function without errors.
Workaround
: There is currently no workaround for this issue.
Expected results
: The Mediator should only attempt to seal the archive file once.
Workaround
: There is no workaround for this issue.
Expected Results
:  The SmartResponse Plugin should execute after selecting the System Monitor Agent.
Workaround
:
There is currently no workaround for this issue
.
Expected Results
: Grouping values in SmartResponse Plugins should be allowed.
Workaround
: There is no workaround for this issue.
Expected Results
: SmartResponse Plugins should fire each time the AIE Rule is triggered.
Workaround
: There is no workaround for this issue.
Expected Results
: The TrueIdentity Sync Client should be able to connect using LDAP via port 636.
Workaround
: Use port 389 instead and ensure the proper certificates are in place for security.
Expected Results
: White space should be allowed in the OU/DC filter.
Workaround
: While there is no workaround for this issue, LogRhythm is investigating a resolution for a future release.
Expected Results
: The TrueIdentity Sync Client should work for any number of users.
Workaround
: While there is no workaround for this issue, the next release of the Sync Client will be able to support larger AD environments.
Expected Results
: When users try to download a PCAP that is no longer available on disk, the error message should provide that detail instead of an unclassified failure.
Workaround
: The error message will be changed in a future release. There are two simple troubleshooting steps to identify if the PCAP exists or if other issues are occurring in the integration: Log in to NetMon directly and verify if the selected PCAP has already aged out or should be available on disk. Recreate the API key for the selected NetMon and update the NetMon configuration in the Deployment Manager.
Expected Results
: When copying widgets, all settings should remain.
Workaround
: Users can add a new widget to the dashboard and configure it manually to work around this issue. This issue is still being actively investigated and will be resolved in a future release.
Expected Results
: All data contained in the .csv export should be valid and match the data displayed in the Web Console.
Workaround
: Export the same investigation from the Client Console or manually adjust the first and last date post export. LogRhythm is investigating a solution to this issue.
Expected Results
: Users should be able to scroll through all TrueIdentity records in the Web Console.
Workaround
: Using filters to find specific data in the TrueIdentity page prevents the error message from showing and helps find data more quickly. LogRhythm is working on a resolution for a future release.
DE1750
Expected Results
: Authentication services for Web Console should handle the change to the new tokens without errors.
Workaround
: Restarting the LogRhythm Authentication API on the Platform Manager mitigates this issue until the next time it occurs.
Expected Results

"No new features in this release.

The Lucene Filters in the Web Console Dashboards have been updated to be more intuitive, allowing the filtering experience to flow better.
There are two Data Indexer updates to the Core SIEM for 7.8.0: added the Cluster Name field to the Configuration Manager and upgraded to Elasticsearch 6.8.15.
The DB upgrade Version Check was updated for 7.8.0 to include newly supported upgrade paths and license check. We are still allowing upgrades to 7.8.0 from anything 7.4.0 and above.
The LogRhythm Diagnostics Tool was added directly
to the Install Wizard for 7.8.0
.

LogRhythm 7.8 is the last published version of the SOAP API. LogRhythm is deprecating the SOAP API in favor of more usable and sustainable integration through RESTful APIs. We encourage customers and partners using the SOAP API to migrate their integrations to REST APIs. For more information on REST integration, see our
REST API
documentation.

The following issues have each been found and reported by multiple users.
Expected Results
: The report should show the accurate last backup time for each database.
Workaround
: Review the backup information in SQL Server Management Studio.
Expected Results
: The TrueIdentity Sync Client should be able to connect using LDAP via port 636.
Workaround
: Use port 389 instead and ensure the proper certificates are in place for security.
Expected Results
: Entities should be retireable and able to be hidden from view.
Workaround
: Contact Technical Support to assist you in removing entities that are no longer needed.
Expected Results
: When exporting reports in .csv format, the column headers should not be repeated on each row.
Workaround
: The report needs to be formatted to remove columns that show the column headers. In addition, LogRhythm data can be exported using Log Distribution Services (LDS).
Expected Results
: Archives should process, seal, and move out of the Unprocessed Archives folder as long as the processing rate is at or below the system specification.
Workaround
: Evaluate system sizing and consider an expansion to meet active load demands. In some systems, increasing the ArchiveSize setting in the Data Processor Advanced Properties to 51200 (from the default value of 10240) can help process archive files faster. If necessary, move large files out of the Unprocessed Archives folder to another drive and slowly feed them back in when the system is successfully processing the live data. A more permanent solution to this issue will be provided in a future release.
Expected Results
:  When the Mediator is handling agent licenses, the heartbeat packet should still be sent so the system shows it is healthy.
Workaround
:
There is currently no workaround for this issue
.
Expected Results:
The Diagnostic logs should be tuned to alarm less frequently.
Workaround
:
There is currently no workaround for this issue
.
Expected Results
: Poorly written AIE Rules should be suspended until they are altered and re-enabled.
Workaround
: Rewrite the AIE Rule for better performance. Often, this involves adding filters, reducing log sources, and modifying the logic. Tuning an AIE Rule requires expertise, so contact LogRhythm Training, Professional Services, or a Sales Engineer to assist if necessary. Additional solutions to identify and monitor poorly performing rules are being developed for a future release.
Expected Results
: The processing of a log should be the same whether it is parsed in Rule Builder or MPE.
Workaround
: Change the sub-rule to use a different tag, such as <Tag1>. If you are experiencing this issue, ensure that you are not using a custom Log Processing Policy and that there are no MPE timeouts. If issues persist, contact Technical Support and reference this bug number (DE1829) or its sister defect (DE1651).
Expected Results
: When users try to download a PCAP that is no longer available on disk, the error message should provide that detail instead of an unclassified failure.
Workaround
: The error message will be changed in a future release. There are two simple troubleshooting steps to identify if the PCAP exists or if other issues are occurring in the integration: Log in to NetMon directly and verify if the selected PCAP has already aged out or should be available on disk. Recreate the API key for the selected NetMon and update the NetMon configuration in the Deployment Manager.
Expected Results
: Case API and Admin API should start when using any size certificate.
Workaround
: Remove the server from the domain and reboot it. Verify that the 512-bit certificate has been removed, re-run the installers, and reboot. To avoid this issue, do not join the domain again or the certificate will be pushed out again. In addition, create a new certificate that uses a 384-bit (or less) hash or exclude the impacted system from the GPO that pushes the certificate.
Expected Results
: These errors should not be generated in the AIE Engine log, but AIE is working and alarms are firing.
Workaround
: There is currently no workaround for this issue.
Expected Results
: When a search times out, a message should inform users and instruct them to re-run the search with a longer timeout.
Workaround
: Increase the timeout on the query and re-run it.
Expected Results
: All chosen fields should appear on the report if they contain data.
Workaround
: Running the report as an investigation yields the expected results in the Network (Impacted) column. LogRhythm is actively working on a solution to this issue in a future release.
Expected Results
: AIE Rule Blocks should fire when they are triggered at the same time.
Workaround
: As the behavior of simultaneous events is unpredictable and the use case for a 0-time interval is rare, LogRhythm does not plan to change this behavior at this time. To avoid the issue, set the evaluation period to 1 second.
Expected Results
: The AIE Data Provider service should start consistently and as expected. Failures should be consistently logged to alert when the service did not start correctly.
Workaround
: Restart the Mediator service to allow the AIE Data Provider service to start. A more permanent solution to this issue is being evaluated for a future release.
Expected Results
: The Alarming and Response Manager should be aware of a change of status of the SRPs and should not continue to attempt to execute them.
Workaround
: Lower the logging level on the ARM to help mitigate this, but contact LogRhythm Technical Support if assistance is needed to retire the SRP.
Expected Results
: The Data Processor and Data Indexer should connect to Service Registry after a reboot of the Platform Manager.
Workaround
: Manually restart the API Gateway and Service Registry services on the Data Indexer and Data Processor after a reboot of the Platform Manager.
Expected Results
: The Console should not freeze when exporting logs.
Workaround
: Export selected logs instead of all logs to allow the export to complete.
Expected Results
: Autogrowth should increase in larger increments so it does not cause fragmentation.
Workaround
: Set the autogrowth settings to the following:EMDB: 256 MBEvents: 1 GBAlarms: 256 MBLogMart: 256 MBCMDB: 256 MB
Expected Results
: The Job Manager should generate a message stating that the results were not complete and the report should indicate partial results.
Workaround
: There is currently no workaround for this issue.
Expected Results
: Exported reports should not duplicate header and footer lines.
Workaround
: Export the report in another format or remove the extra lines from the .csv.
Expected Results
:  The SmartResponse Plugin should execute after selecting the System Monitor Agent.
Workaround
:
There is currently no workaround for this issue
.
In certain circumstances when Entity Archive settings are turned on, customers may receive the following error:
**ERROR** Failed to locate or create inactive subdirectory: The given key was not present in the dictionary.. Inactive archive files will be temporarily stored at the root of the system drive (C:\ in most cases). This error must be corrected in order for inactive archives to be stored at the specified location.
Expected Results
: Entity archiving should function without errors.
Workaround
: There is currently no workaround for this issue.
Expected Results
: All data contained in the .csv export should be valid and match the data displayed in the Web Console.
Workaround
: Export the same investigation from the Client Console or manually adjust the first and last date post export. LogRhythm is investigating a solution to this issue.
Expected Results
: When copying widgets, all settings should remain.
Workaround
: Users can add a new widget to the dashboard and configure it manually to work around this issue. This issue is still being actively investigated and will be resolved in a future release.
Expected Results
: The date and time of the AIE Event should not have a future time.
Workaround
: There is no workaround for this issue.
Expected Results
: White space should be allowed in the OU/DC filter.
Workaround
: While there is no workaround for this issue, LogRhythm is investigating a resolution for a future release.
Expected Results
: Users should be able to scroll through all TrueIdentity records in the Web Console.
Workaround
: Using filters to find specific data in the TrueIdentity page prevents the error message from showing and helps find data more quickly. LogRhythm is working on a resolution for a future release.
Expected Results
: An alarm should only generate when the cluster health changes to red.
Workaround
: Edit the impacted alarm to suppress for 24 hours or disable that alarm.
Expected Results
: The SmartResponse Plugin should be triggered by any Alarm meeting the criteria.
Workaround
: There is currently no workaround for this issue.
Expected Results
: The TrueIdentity Sync Client should work for any number of users.
Workaround
: While there is no workaround for this issue, the next release of the Sync Client will be able to support larger AD environments.
Expected Results
: AIE Summary Fields should be displayed on all AIE Notification emails.
Workaround
: View the AIE Summary Fields in the Alarm instead of the Notification email.
Expected Results
: AIE Rules should not fire if the rule block relationship is not met.
Workaround
: Change the Host (origin) or Host (impacted) fields to IP Address, and the AIE Rule works as expected.
Expected Results
: Identity data should appear in reports that contain those fields.
Workaround
: Run an investigation to provide the same information.
Expected Results
: Scheduled reports should not be sent to disabled accounts.
Workaround
: There is currently no workaround for this issue.
DE1750
DE147
Expected Results
:
Authentication services for Web Console should handle the change to the new tokens without errors
.
Workaround
: Restarting the LogRhythm Authentication API on the Platform Manager mitigates this issue until the next time it occurs.
Expected Results
: The Web Console should not time out when downloading large PCAP files.
Workaround
: Change the time out setting in the Configuration Manager.
Expected Results
: When the Admin API log generates errors, it should provide some context within the error message.
Workaround
: There is currently no workaround for this issue.
Expected Results
: Logs in this directory should be purged after the number of days defined for expiration has passed, defaulted to 7 days.
Workaround
:  Manually remove these files to prevent the C drive from filling up.
Expected Results
: Disabling Log Source Virtualization should not change the behavior of the System Monitor.
Workaround
: This issue is caused by the scsm.ini file not being updated immediately. To work around it, refresh the Log Sources tab in the Client Console to force the .ini file to refresh.
DE260
DE9367
Expected Results
: SQL deadlock issues should not cause a missed heartbeat.
Workaround
: While there is no known workaround, LogRhythm is actively investigating this issue for a solution.
Expected Results
: The Client Console should provide an alternate way to retrieve the data if Crystal Reports is not able to render it.
Workaround
: Decrease the amount of data the report is trying to retrieve or export the data instead.
Expected Results
: The Admin API should connect to SQL during failover.
Workaround
: Manually change the Global IP to the Management IP. This may need to be done after each upgrade.

"Explanation:
A newly developed RESTful Alarm API enables users to add alarm functionality to their LogRhythm deployment at parity with the capabilities of the existing SOAP API.
Benefit:
The Alarm API can be used in third-party integration, allowing customers to extend the LogRhythm solution or integrate it with other systems. It also brings LogRhythm closer to full deprecation of the complex SOAP API for Alarm Service. For more information, see Deprecated Features.
Explanation:
Cloud log collection enables users to create, configure, and manage Beat Log Sources and Sysmon Log Sources through a user interface in the Web Console.
Benefit:
Instead of having to configure log sources through the Console or command line interface, users can now configure log sources through a GUI using a list of available log sources.
Explanation:
From the Inspector, users can now launch a search on a single user or host and land on a details page that displays the search results in the new Timeline widget.
Benefit:
The timeline widget is a chronological way to ""tell a story"" about the user or host activity, including a contextualized sentence helping explain the log activity in plain English.

Numerous third-party libraries have been updated to mitigate
the risk of security vulnerabilities manifesting in LogRhythm 7.7.0. For more information, see Open Source License Acknowledgements.
Updates to the Admin API provide
access to Notification Groups at the user profile level. New Users and Notification endpoints are now available in the Admin API.
If a SysMon Agent is licensed as a Collection Agent, then EDR features are now disabled. This gives users control over use of the EDR feature for a license user.
If a SysMon Agent is licensed as a Collection Agent, then EDR features are now disabled. This gives users control over use of the EDR feature for a license user.
The DB upgrade process now includes a measure to
validate that a user trying to upgrade LogRhythm has a valid license file for the target version, and provides a warning/error that a new license is required before proceeding.

LogRhythm is deprecating the SOAP API in favor of more usable and sustainable integration through RESTful APIs. Starting with the release of LogRhythm SIEM version 7.7.0, development work will cease on the SOAP API. We will still publish the SOAP API installer, and existing integrations will continue to function. LogRhythm 7.8.0 (expected Q2 2021) will be the last published version of the SOAP API. We encourage customers and partners using the SOAP API to migrate their integrations to REST APIs. For more information on REST integration, see our REST API documentation.

Special characters such as
(')
are no longer allowed in the LicensedTo field during license generation, allowing Mediator service to start without error.
Missing Messaging Performance Counters or corruption to counters no longer prevents Mediator from starting up.
Sub-rule field mapping tags have been removed from the MPERule table.
Active Directory sync now validates when using secure LDAP.
Log source virtualization templates are now imported by automatic KB sync.
LogRhythm API Gateway now uses strong ciphers.
The Carpenter service can now connect to SQL in non-FIPS mode.
Having two user accounts with same first and last name
in an AD group now
logs a descriptive error and does not prevent AD sync from completing.
LDS no longer stops forwarding when Log Source lists are updated.
SNMP Trap Receiver configuration encryption in scsm.ini has been fixed.
The Admin API Get Identity Identifiers now supports pagination in API responses.
The LDS secure TCP option in the Network Protocol dropdown of the Syslog Receiver Properties is now working properly.
Restricted Analysts/Admins can now see TrueIdentity data.
Data Indexer upgrade guidance with regard to preinstall.sh has been updated and clarified.
The Host Details page was improperly displaying in 7.6.0, and is now displaying properly.
Elasticsearch upgrades for Data Indexer can now continue even when an environment variable is deleted.
Data Indexer upgrade no longer throws a LRDXNode Installer Warm Node Insufficient Resources error.
7.6.0 XM DR installation documentation no longer lists duplicate cluster names.
The Job Manager now retries three times if there is an error during AD group member lookup. After three failures, Job Manager skips that group.
Renaming an Active Directory group being used in AD Group-based authorization is now caught and logged as a warning during the group-based authorization sync.
An error in TrueIdentity sync on large data sets no longer causes MPE to stop processing.

CloudAI data is now accessible in Web Console with SSO login.
SSO timeout no longer occurs when multifactor authentication is enabled and the user authenticates with SSO.
Elasticsearch startup has been modified to prevent Elasticsearch from starting when Windows Service Registry is not available.
Transporter now fully starts after automatic restart at five minutes past midnight UTC.
Client Console no longer freezes filtering log sources on the Log Source tab.
The migrate-consul-keyspace.ps1 script has been signed.
Admin API GET /identities/ no longer returns duplicate identities.

Elasticsearch startup has been modified to prevent Elasticsearch from starting when Service Registry is not available.
JRE (java) files have been excluded from the hashed files list to allow users to apply security patches.
Admin API's Create Agent Record action now works properly.

The following issues have each been found and reported by multiple users.
Expected Results:
AIE Rules should not fire if the rule block relationship is not met.
Workaround:
Change the Host (origin) or Host (impacted) fields to IP Address, and the AIE Rule works as expected.
Expected Results:
AIE Summary Fields should be displayed on all AIE Notification emails.
Workaround:
View the AIE Summary Fields in the Alarm instead of the Notification email.
Expected Results:
AIE Rule Blocks should fire when they are triggered at the same time.
Workaround:
As the behavior of simultaneous events is unpredictable and the use case for a 0-time interval is rare, LogRhythm does not plan to change this behavior at this time. To avoid the issue, set the evaluation period to 1 second.
Expected Results:
These errors should not be reported in the AIE Engine log, but AIE is working and alarms are firing.
Workaround:
There is currently no workaround for this issue.
Expected Results:
Poorly written AIE Rules should be suspended until they are altered and re-enabled.
Workaround:
Rewrite the AIE Rule for better performance. Often, this involves adding filters, reducing log sources, and modifying the logic. Tuning an AIE Rule requires expertise, so contact LogRhythm Training, Professional Services, or a Sales Engineer to assist if necessary. Additional solutions to identify and monitor poorly performing rules are being developed for a future release.
Expected Results:
AIE Rules fire as expected.
Workaround:
There is no workaround at this time. LogRhythm is actively investigating the issue for a future release.
Expected Results:
Alarms do not fire if a log is received for a Not Observed block.
Workaround:
There is no workaround at this time. LogRhythm is investigating this issue for a future release.
Expected Results:
These logs should be automatically purged after 7 days as defined.
Workaround:
Sort by log date and delete all older logs.
Expected Results:
Alarms should execute quickly as expected with other AIE Alarms.
Workaround:
There is currently no workaround for this issue.
7.4.9,
7.4.10
Expected Results:
The Alarming and Response Manager should able to send alarm notifications using any SMTP server and SSL authentication.
Workaround:
There is currently no workaround for this issue.
Expected Results:
Case API and Admin API should start when using any size certificate.
Workaround:
Remove the server from the domain and reboot it. Verify that the 512-bit certificate has been removed, re-run the installers, and reboot. To avoid this issue, do not join the domain again or the certificate will be pushed out again. In addition, create a new certificate that uses a 384-bit (or less) hash or exclude the impacted system from the GPO that pushes the certificate.
Expected Results:
The extra semicolon, which is an optional valid separator in a content-type header, should not prevent scripts from working upon upgrade.
Workaround:
There is no workaround for this issue at this time. A solution is being investigated for a future release.
Expected Results:
The processing of a log should be the same whether it is parsed in Rule Builder or MPE.
Workaround:
Change the sub-rule to use a different tag, such as <Tag1>. If you are experiencing this issue, ensure that you are not using a custom Log Processing Policy and that there are no MPE timeouts. If issues persist, contact Technical Support and reference this bug number (DE1829) or its sister defect (DE1651).
Expected Results:
When a search times out, a message should inform users and instruct them to re-run the search with a longer timeout.
Workaround:
Increase the timeout on the query and re-run it.
Expected Results:
Disabling Log Source Virtualization should not change the behavior of the System Monitor.
Workaround:
This issue is caused by the scsm.ini file not being updated immediately. To work around it, refresh the Log Sources tab in the Client Console to force the .ini file to refresh.
Expected Results:
Identity data appears in reports that contain those fields.
Workaround:
Run an investigation to provide the same information.
Expected Results:
All chosen fields should appear on the report if they contain data.
Workaround:
Running the report as an investigation yields the expected results in the Network (Impacted) column. LogRhythm is actively working on a solution to this issue in a future release.
Expected Results:
When exporting reports in .csv format, the column headers should not be repeated on each row.
Workaround:
The report needs to be formatted to remove columns that show the column headers. In addition, LogRhythm data can be exported using Log Distribution Services (LDS).
Expected Results:
Entities should be retireable and able to be hidden from view.
Workaround:
Contact Technical Support to assist you in removing entities that are no longer needed.
Expected Results:
When editing a report template, existing fields should remain unless they are explicitly removed.
Workaround:
When editing a report template that contains the Normal Date field, add that field back to the template prior to saving it.
Expected Results:
The Configuration Manager should load immediately and show the services in the correct state.
Workaround:
The Configuration Manager will eventually load if given a little time.  When the services show down, a refresh of the Configuration Manager should show them correctly.  We are working on a resolution to this issue.
Expected Results:
The Diagnostic logs should be tuned to alarm less frequently.
Workaround:
There is no workaround for this issue at this time.
Expected Results:
Alarms should continue to trigger and be displayed in the Web Console.
Workaround:
Contact Technical Support for assistance, as there could be many reasons for this behavior beyond this defect. Support will help determine the root cause.
Expected Results:
The Data Processor and Data Indexer connect to Service Registry after a reboot of the Platform Manager.
Workaround:
Manually restart the API Gateway and Service Registry services on the Data Indexer and Data Processor after a reboot of the Platform Manager.
Expected Results:
The ""non-paged pool"" should not increase and cause system performance issues.
Workaround:
Restart the LogRhythm API Gateway service.
Expected Results: Autogrowth increases in larger increments so it does not cause fragmentation.
Workaround:
Set the autogrowth settings to the following:
EMDB: 256 MB
Events: 1 GB
Alarms: 256 MB
LogMart: 256 MB
CMDB: 256 MB
Expected Results:
SQL deadlock issues should not cause a missed heartbeat.
Workaround:
While there is no known workaround, this issue is being actively investigated for a solution.
Expected Results: Deadlocks should not cause a missed heartbeat alarm.
Workaround:
While there is no workaround for this issue, LogRhythm is investigating a solution.
Expected Results:
Authentication services for Web Console should not be interrupted by the change to the new tokens.
Workaround:
Restarting the LogRhythm Authentication API on the Platform Manager mitigates this issue until the next time it occurs.
Expected Results:
The Client Console should provide an alternate way to retrieve the data if Crystal Reports is not able to render it.
Workaround:
Decrease the amount of data the report is trying to retrieve or export the data instead.
Expected Results:
Scheduled reports should not be sent to disabled accounts.
Workaround:
There is currently no workaround for this issue.
7.4.9,
7.4.10
Expected Results:
The Job Manager should able to send scheduled reports using any SMTP server and SSL authentication.
Workaround:
There is currently no workaround for this issue.
Expected Results:
The report should show the accurate last backup time for each database.
Workaround:
Review the backup information in SQL Server Management Studio.
Expected Results:
Cache refresh and License enumeration does not interfere with the heartbeat. We should send heartbeat packets at the required interval.
Workaround:
There is currently no workaround for this issue.
Expected Results:
The AIE Data Provider service should start consistently and as expected. Failures should be consistently logged to alert when the service did not start correctly.
Workaround:
Restart the Mediator service to allow the AIE Data Provider service to start. A more permanent solution to this issue is being evaluated for a future release.
Expected Results:
Archives should process, seal, and move out of the Unprocessed Archives folder as long as the processing rate is at or below the system specification.
Workaround:
Evaluate system sizing and consider an expansion to meet active load demands. In some systems, increasing the ArchiveSize setting in the Data Processor Advanced Properties to 51200 (from the default value of 10240) can help process archive files faster. If necessary, move large files out of the Unprocessed Archives folder to another drive and slowly feed them back in when the system is successfully processing the live data. A more permanent solution to this issue will be provided in a future release.
Expected Results:
The TrueIdentity Sync Client should work for any number of users.
Workaround:
While there is no workaround for this issue, the next release of the Sync Client will be able to support larger AD environments.
Expected Results:
White space should be allowed in the OU/DC filter.
Workaround:
While there is no workaround for this issue, LogRhythm is investigating a resolution for a future release.
Expected Results:
Users should be able to scroll through all TrueIdentity records in the Web Console.
Workaround:
Using filters to find specific data in the TrueIdentity page prevents the error message from showing and helps find data more quickly. LogRhythm is working on a resolution for a future release.
Expected Results:
The Web Console should not time out when downloading large PCAP files.
Workaround:
Change the time out setting in the Configuration Manager.
Expected Results:
When copying widgets, all settings should remain.
Workaround:
Users can add a new widget to the dashboard and configure it manually to work around this issue. This issue is still being actively investigated and will be resolved in a future release.
Expected Results:
When users try to download a PCAP that is no longer available on disk, the error message should provide that detail instead of an unclassified failure.
Workaround:
The error message will be changed in a future release. There are two simple troubleshooting steps to identify if the PCAP exists or if other issues are occurring in the integration: Log in to NetMon directly and verify if the selected PCAP has already aged out or should be available on disk. Recreate the API key for the selected NetMon and update the NetMon configuration in the Deployment Manager.
Expected Results:
All data contained in the .csv export should be valid and match the data displayed in the Web Console.
Workaround:
Export the same investigation from the Client Console or manually adjust the first and last date post export. LogRhythm is investigating a solution to this issue.
Expected Results:
The Current Processing Rate widget shows all logs being processed.
Workaround:
Resolve any log source issues that are causing old logs to be ingested, or use Grafana or Performance Counters to check the current processing rate.
Expected Results:
The Download PCAP button appears when reviewing NetMon logs.
Workaround:
Reload the frame with the Download PCAP button to activate it.
In certain circumstances, a SmartResponse action may fail to execute with an error: ""No System Monitor Associated with execution target.""
Expected Results:
The SmartResponse Plugin should execute after selecting the System Monitor Agent.
Workaround:
There is currently no workaround for this issue.
Expected Results:
The remote web server should be enforcing HSTS.
Workaround:
Configure the remote web server to use HSTS.
When the browser window is zoomed out, the Node-Link Graph on the Web Console dashboards may display an error: ""Failed to establish logs subscription with the Web Console API."" This is not related to the zoom functionality within the Node-Link Graph itself.
Expected Results:
The Node-Link Graph should function regardless of the browser zoom level.
Workaround:
Return the browser to 100% zoom and refresh the Web Console.
Occasionally in multiple Web Console environments, AIE Drilldown does not export results or show data in the filters.
Expected Results:
Drilldowns should always allow export of results and filters should always have data.
Workaround:
Use the Client Console to drill down and export results.
When SSL Port In Redirects is set to Exclude in the Web Console configuration, links in Alarm and Case notification emails do not work.
Expected Results:
The links sent in Case and Alarm notification emails should redirect to port 443 instead of 8443, as they are coming from an external location.
Workaround:
Open the Web Console and manually find the Alarm or Case to review.
Scheduled reports that do not complete within an hour return only partial results without indication of additional results available.
Expected Results:
The Job Manager should generate a message stating that the results were not complete and the report should indicate partial results.
Workaround:
There is currently no workaround for this issue.
When clicking Case Evidence logs from the Case page, the Analyze window shows a Custom Filter that prevents the logs from displaying.
Expected Results:
Clicking Case Evidence logs should open an Analyze page showing the logs selected.
Workaround:
To show the logs, click the
X
next to the Custom Filter.
If FIPS and Integrated Security are enabled in a Disaster Recovery (DR) environment, the Admin API errors during startup because of a failure to connect to SQL during failover.
Expected Results:
The Admin API should connect to SQL during failover.
Workaround:
Manually change the Global IP to the Management IP. This may need to be done after each upgrade.
When running the LogRhythm Infrastructure Installer (LRII), you may receive the error: ""No plan file found in LogRhythm Service Registry KV store."" This is caused by the plan file not fully updating into the Consul KV store, and only happens in certain environments.
Expected Results:
LRII should be able to run multiple times without affecting the plan file.
Workaround:
For assistance with this issue, contact LogRhythm Technical Support.
In certain circumstances, Elasticsearch uses more memory than the set limit, causing performance issues on the server.
Expected Results:
Elasticsearch should abide by the memory limit that is set.
Workaround:
For a workaround, contact LogRhythm Technical Support.
Searches and drilldowns using Location lists do not return results.
Expected Results:
Search results should return if using a Location list.
Workaround:
Clone the original rule and replace the Location list with manual entries for the countries in Location (Origin).
After the Active Directory Sync, some Active Directory users may be disabled.
Expected Results:
Only users who are disabled in Active Directory should be disabled within LogRhythm.
Workaround:
Manually re-enable users by logging in to the Console as a Global Administrator or LogRhythm Admin user.
When using a Direction filter in the Web Console dashboard and drilling into any of the TopX widgets, the data shown in the Analyzer Grid contains logs that do not match the dashboard filter.
Expected Results:
Drilling into data on a dashboard should not change the dashboard filter criteria.
Workaround:
Reapply the dashboard filter.
In certain circumstances, customers with warm node indices may experience failed searches against those indices. This is due to Columbo being unable to close certain warm indices.
Expected Results:
Columbo should handle the warm node indices correctly and allow searches.
Workaround:
For assistance with this workaround, contact LogRhythm Technical Support.
When viewing the Metrics dashboard in Grafana, the Memory Used Percentage widget in the LR Metrics - Deployment View dashboard shows incorrect results for timeframes greater than three hours.
Expected Results:
The aggregator in the widget query should use an average calculation instead of a sum calculation.
Workaround:
For assistance with this workaround, see
this knowledge article on the LogRhythm Community
.
In certain circumstances, an Alarm does not associate with a SmartResponse Plugin and does not run the SmartResponse Plugin.
Expected Results:
The SmartResponse Plugin should be triggered by any Alarm meeting the criteria.
Workaround:
There is currently no workaround for this issue.

An alarm is a record of an event, or series of events, that triggered an alarm rule. In LogRhythm SIEM, alarm rules watch for certain conditions such as attacks on the network, compliance issues, system errors, and so on. For example, if log data reveals that a Trojan attempted to enter the network, an alarm rule such as ""Alarm on Malware"" is triggered that notifies administrators. The alarm rule can also trigger remediation (SmartResponse) actions, such as scripts for disabling an Active Directory account or killing a running process.
LogRhythm SIEM provides a wide variety of predefined rules, which administrators can load through the Knowledge Base Import process. Alarm rules are configured and managed in the Client Console. For more information, see
Alarm Rules
in the Client Console (Administrator's Guide).

An alarm can be triggered in LogRhythm SIEM, as follows:
The Data Processor receives logs from Agents. The log processing engine, called the Message Processing Engine (MPE), then processes log data and classifies a subset as MPE Events. For more details, see the
LogRhythm Architecture
.
The Data Processor receives logs from Agents. The log processing engine, called the Message Processing Engine (MPE), then processes log data and classifies a subset as MPE Events. For more details, see the
LogRhythm Architecture
.

The Data Processor forwards MPE events to the Platform Manager. If the Advanced Intelligence (AI) Engine is configured in the LogRhythm SIEM deployment, the Data Processor can also send copies of logs to the AI Engine for additional analysis. The AI Engine evaluates the logs against its AIE Correlation Rules. If a log triggers an AIE Rule, the AI Engine sends an AIE event to the Platform Manager (with Alarm rules already applied).
As events move into the Platform Manager, the integrated Alarming and Response Manager (ARM) applies Alarm rules to the live stream of events data. If an Alarm rule matches an event, an alarm is created.
Alarms can trigger one or both of the following actions:
Notification
. An alert is sent to administrators via SNMP traps, email (SMTP), or text files.
Remediation (SmartResponse)
. An automated script responds with an action to resolve the issue.

. An automated script responds with an action to resolve the issue.

SmartResponse actions are automated defensive or operational responses to triggered alarm rules. The following examples describe some of the different functions that SmartResponse actions can perform:
When compromised systems are detected, SmartResponse actions can perform vulnerability scans or packet captures on the target hosts.
SmartResponse actions can kill inappropriate processes (such as BitTorrent or a Peer2Peer application) detected on a server.
When LogRhythm SIEM observes concurrent successful logins to the same account from two different countries, SmartResponse actions can disable the account.
SmartResponse actions can automatically set network devices to debug-level logging when LogRhythm SIEM observes critical operations issues on them.
An alarm rule can be configured to start up to 10 SmartResponse actions when triggered. Actions can be run immediately or after a quorum-approval process. In a quorum process, individuals or groups are required to approve the action before it runs (up to three levels of approval may be configured). When multiple individuals are assigned to the same level, only one person needs to provide approval or denial.
From the Web Console, you can use the Inspector panel to view the details of SmartResponse actions and manage their approval statuses. For more information, see
View Additional Alarm Information
and
Approve or Deny SmartResponse Actions
.
You cannot create, configure, or remove SmartResponse actions with the Web Console. These tasks can only be performed in the Client Console.

"You can use the Inspector panel to view alarm metadata as well as the details related to any SmartResponse actions, user comments, or AIE rules that are associated with an alarm. You can also use the Inspector panel to make changes to an alarm status, add the alarm to a case, and start a drill down search.
The following procedure can also be directly applied to alarm cards displayed in case evidence outside the Alarms page.
To view additional information or make changes using the Inspector panel:
On the navigation bar, click
Alarms
.
Select an alarm by doing one of the following:
In the Alarm card view, click an Alarm card to select it. A glowing blue border appears around the selected Alarm card.
In the Alarm grid view, click anywhere in a row on the Alarm grid. The row is filled light blue.

Metadata fields contain details of a log message in a simple format within the LogRhythm databases. Metadata is parsed directly from a log message (explicit) or can be inferred from a log message (implicit). Metadata might include such information as the direction of the data flow or the number of bytes in a data flow.
For more detailed information about metadata fields, see the
LogRhythm Schema Dictionary and Guide
.
Metadata field names in LogRhythm do not always match the corresponding field in Lucene syntax. The following sections provide details around metadata field names in the Web Console, how they map to Lucene syntax, and a
brief
field description.

Dashboards refer to the interchangeable widget-based user interfaces on the Dashboards page, Analyze page, Cases page, and Reports page. Predefined dashboards are available for these pages, but you can also create, customize, and save additional dashboards to accommodate your different information needs.
When you first log in to the Web Console, the Dashboards page displays. This is your main view for reviewing real-time Events data as it is processed through LogRhythm SIEM in easy-to-read charts and graphs that automatically update their displays to reflect changes in live data. The Web Console can display up to the last 250,000 Events (approximately) in the cache.
If you are logged in as a restricted user, the Processing Rate gauge, Trend chart, Component Status widget, System Database Usage widget, and Threat Activity Map do not appear on the Dashboards page. Global Admins can set
Management Permissions
in the Client Console to allow Restricted Admins view permissions for the
Database Usage, Component Status, and Processing widgets.
The name next to the Dashboard icon on the upper-right side of the relevant pages tells you which dashboard displays.


Public dashboards can be accessed by all Web Console users, but only Global Administrators can create or modify them. A private dashboard view can be accessed and viewed only by the individual user who created it. Permission to create and manage private dashboards extends to all users.
You can download Dashboards by going to the
LogRhythm Community
and clicking on the
Shareables
link on menu at the top of the page. The filters allow you to choose from supported and unsupported Dashboards, as well as ones created by LogRhythm or by other users.

"The LogRhythm Web Console allows you to filter data on dashboards, widgets, and the Analyze page by using Lucene search syntax. Lucene is an open source text retrieval library released under the Apache Software License. For more information, see
Lucene Search Syntax
or the Lucene wiki:
http://lucene.apache.org/core/2_9_

"Syntax for a basic query includes the following elements:
Type a query using the following basic syntax:
metadataField:""term""
EXAMPLE
To run a query for all activity that falls under the Malware classification:
classificationName:""Malware""
To run a query for the impacted user account jon.smith:
account:""jon.smith""
Lucene search is case sensitive for the metadata field value. Therefore, when entering the metadata field value, you must use the correct capitalization. If your metadata field value does not exactly match the capitalization, the LogRhythm Web Console widgets return No data available error messages.
For example, when searching on the metadata field classificationName:
In contrast, Lucene search is not case sensitive the term value.
For example, when searching on the term Malware:
For more detailed information on metadata fields and correct capitalization, see the
Metadata Fields
section.
To escape a special character that is part of the query syntax, use a backslash before the character. Special characters that require this treatment are: + - && || ! ( ) { } [ ] ^ "" ~ * ? : \
EXAMPLE
To run a query for an origin user whose name is jon*:
login:""jon\*""
To run a query for an origin user whose name is jon.smith-miller:

"

When you use the OR operator, the filter displays activity that includes any of the values listed.
The default Boolean operator is OR. If you do not include an operator when searching on multiple criteria, the query runs as an OR search. You can also use || in place of OR.
EXAMPLE -
OR
To run a query for all activity that falls under the Malware classification or that originated from a particular host, all of the following syntaxes are acceptable:
classificationName:""Malware"" originHost: ""106.194.190.210""
classificationName:""Malware"" OR originHost: ""106.194.190.210""
classificationName:""Malware"" || originHost: ""106.194.190.210""

When you use the AND operator, the filter displays activity that includes every value listed.
You can also use && in place of AND.
EXAMPLE -
AND
To run a query to see whether Malware activity originated from a particular host, you can use either of the following:
classificationName:""Malware"" AND originHost: ""106.194.190.210""
classificationName:""Malware"" && originHost: ""106.194.190.210""

When you use the NOT operator, the filter excludes activity associated with the value entered after NOT.
You can also use ! in place of NOT.
EXAMPLE -
NOT
To run a query to see activity associated with user account jon.smith that is not classified as Malware, you can use either of the following:
login:""jon.smith"" NOT classificationName:""Malware""
login:""jon.smith"" ! classificationName:""Malware""
To run a NOT search by itself, use the following wildcard syntax:
*:* AND NOT classificationName:""Malware""

To search by a range, include the TO operator between the parameters. To run an inclusive search, use square brackets [ ]. To run an exclusive search, use curly brackets { }.
EXAMPLE -
TO
To run a query for the host from which a log activity originated that INCLUDES the first and last IP addresses listed:
originHost:[106.194.190.210 TO 106.194.190.250]
To run a query for the host from which a log activity originated that EXCLUDES the first and last IP addresses listed:
originHost:{106.194.190.210 TO 106.194.190.250}
To run a query for a log of a certain priority ranking that INCLUDES a ranking 40 or greater:
priority:[40 TO *]

To run a search on a log date, you must convert the time to epoch format in milliseconds. There are several online tools to help you make the conversion, including EpochConverter and Unix Time Stamp.
EXAMPLE -
DATE
To run a query for all logs after October 30, 2016 at 9 A.M. local time:
normalDate:{1477839600000 TO *}

You can run a query for multiple values in the same filter by enclosing all terms in parentheses. This is similar to using the OR operator, except that you can only search one metadata field with this syntax.
EXAMPLE -
GROUPING
To run a query for all activity that falls under the Malware or Attack classifications:
classificationName:(""Malware"" ""Attack"")

To combine any of these query types into one query, use parentheses to group fields.
EXAMPLE -
FIELD GROUPING
To run a query for the host from which Malware activity originated that excludes the first and last IP addresses in two different ranges:
originHost:({106.194.190.210 TO 106.194.190.250} OR {106.194.190.256 TO 106.194.190.220}) AND classificationName:""Malware""
To run a query for Malware or Compromise activity that impacted any of three separate users but that does not come from a particular IP address:
login:(""jon.smith"" ""fred.miller"" ""janice.jones"") AND classificationName:(""Malware"" ""Compromise"") AND NOT originHost:""106.194.190.210""

"In certain circumstances, you may need to use a wildcard query. For example, you may want to find data on any classification name that contains Malware in its name (Malware X, Malware Y, Malware Z, etc.). If you run a query using the term Malware, your search results will display only exact matches. You will see data for Malware but not for Malware X, Malware Y, or Malware Z. To get the data you are looking for, you need to use a wildcard query.
For one-word wildcard filtering, remove the quotation marks and place an asterisk (*) where you would like to use a wildcard.
EXAMPLE - ONE WORD
To run a query
for all classifications containing the word Malware:
classificationName:*Malware*
For wildcard searches using multiple terms, use forward slashes (in place of quotation marks) to indicate regex syntax. In Lucene queries, the set of operators for wildcard searches is limited when compared to the full Java-supported regex.
For single-character wildcards, use a period and question mark combination (.?).
EXAMPLE - SINGLE CHARACTER
To run a query for impacted users named Jon, Jan, Jin, or Jen:
login:/J.?n/
For multi-character wildcards, use an asterisk (*) when your search term contains a single word. When your search term contains multiple words, use a period and asterisk combination (.*).
EXAMPLE - MULTI CHARACTER
To run a query for all common events that begin with ""AIE: SANS"":
commonEventName:/AIE: SANS.*/
To run a query for all impacted users whose name begins with Jo:
login:Jo*
To run a query for all impacted users whose account ends with Smith:
login:*Smith
To search for all classifications containing the word Malware:
classificationName:*Malware*
You can also use wildcard queries to filter results by blank or non-blank term fields.
EXAMPLE - BLANK and NON-BLANK
To run a query for all log messages classified under any major activity group:
classificationName:/.*/
To run a query for all log messages NOT classified under any major activity group:
*:* AND NOT classificationName:/.*/
To use a fuzzy match to locate terms similar to what you type, use a tilde (~) with no quotations marks or slashes.
EXAMPLE - FUZZY MATCH
To run a query for impacted users whose names are similar to Jon, such as Ron or John:
login:Jon~

This schema guide contains descriptions of every field, including the intent for the field, guidance for how to parse data into the field, use cases for each field, and sample logs showing correct, incorrect, and ambiguous examples.
The fields in this guide are organized according to the tabs in the Analyzer grid in the LogRhythm Web Console. To access the Analyzer grid on the Dashboards page or Analyze page, at the lower-right side of the page, click the
Logs
tab.
Fields that are listed with [7.2] after the field name are not available in LogRhythm versions earlier than 7.2.1.


LogRhythm presents log sources from the perspective of the impacted system, the origin system, or both. Although origin and impacted align with the network-centric view of ""source"" and ""destination,"" origin and impacted are meant to represent a security-centric view, in which:
In a security-centric view:
Origin represents:
The client in “client server.”
The attacker in a security context.
The cause of an observation.
The user account who performed an action.
The client in “client server.”
The attacker in a security context.
The cause of an observation.
The user account who performed an action.
Impacted represents:
The server in ""client server.""
The target in a security context, or the device impacted by a security event.
The effect of an observation.
The user affected by an action.
The server in ""client server.""
The target in a security context, or the device impacted by a security event.
The effect of an observation.
The user affected by an action.

The use of origin and impacted is particularly important for understanding the schema. Origin and impacted apply to IP addresses, hosts, users, and other fields that describe the object in the log. These fields include:
Hostname
MAC address
Interface
IP address
User
For an IP address, the schema parses into fields called SIP and DIP, where SIP represents origin and DIP represents impacted.

The origin/impacted context can be defined and changed in multiple places:
Selecting correct parsing fields
. This is important when converting the network view of source and destination to the security view of origin and impacted. Origin is not always source and impacted is not always destination.
Rule definition with explicit options
. The rule can explicitly force a conversion of direction.
Automatic Host Contextualization (AHC)
. The AHC feature can change direction based on tables of well-known ports and protocols.

O365 SharePoint. SIP is explicitly called out, but because O365 is the cloud, there is no discernable impacted hostname.

This is not a security event, so apply the network-centric view of client vs. server. The client is referenced in the SIP, and therefore SIP (origin) is the IP Origin. The IP Impacted is undefined, but the Impacted Host can be inferred from the log source. It is ambiguous whether the log source is the agent calling the API or refers to O365.
Oracle 10g Audit. Client is the source of the session, but also impacted by the logoff.

Because this is not a security log, the host is likely the client (in client server). The host becomes the Origin Host. The Impacted Host is the Oracle server (automatically resolved by the log source).
Windows Application. <computer> is where the event log was written.

<Security/></System><EventData>The alert for 'oldest unsent transaction' has been raised. The current value of '3' surpasses the threshold '1'.</EventData></Event>
The computer is the Impacted Host because there is no other context. Because the log came from this computer, it is the source of the log message.
Cb Response. The endpoint is where the file originated in the scan, but is also likely impacted.

Because this is a security event that occurred on the endpoint, the endpoint is the Impacted Host. The other hosts involved (for example, CB server or agent reading syslog) are not relevant to the security context.
CylancePROTECT. The threat originated from the device and IP, but is also impacted by the threat and the quarantine.

Because this is a security event, the Device Name is the Impacted Host.

Not all fields that are parsed in a rule are stored in the Data Indexer as parsed or displayed in the console as parsed. For example, the Web Console Duration field is a calculation based on one or more time-based parsing fields. Similarly, there are more than a dozen fields for bytes as a size, but only one value is stored and only one value is displayed.
Polyfields are a special type of display field used for aggregating across similar source data. For example, the Impacted Host polyfield could contain a hostname, an IP address, or a well-known entity. The hostname and IP address may also be stored separately. The polyfield generally has preference logic at the code level to determine which source field to display.
When reading this document, pay particular attention to fields that are called out as source data for a polyfield, or parsing fields that are transformed into final data fields.

You can approve or deny SmartResponse actions from the Alarm card view on the Alarms page or wherever else you are able to view detailed alarm information (such as in the Current Case panel or the Inspector panel of the Alarm grid view).
To approve or deny SmartResponse actions:
On the navigation bar, click
Alarms
,
Select an alarm with a pending SmartResponse.
Click the
Inspector
tab to expand the Inspector panel, if necessary.
The Inspector panel opens. In the SmartResponse actions section, Approve and Deny buttons are displayed for each pending SmartResponse action. At the bottom of the section, the action run order is indicated by one of the following messages:
Run actions at the same time
. Indicates that none of the SmartResponse actions depend upon each other, and that you can run any one of them regardless of whether the others are run.
Run actions in the order listed
. Indicates an interdependency that requires each action to run before the subsequent action can be run. To properly approve these interdependent actions, they need to be approved in the order that they are listed from top to bottom.
Run actions at the same time
. Indicates that none of the SmartResponse actions depend upon each other, and that you can run any one of them regardless of whether the others are run.
Run actions in the order listed
. Indicates an interdependency that requires each action to run before the subsequent action can be run. To properly approve these interdependent actions, they need to be approved in the order that they are listed from top to bottom.
Click either
Approve
or
Deny
for each SmartResponse action in accordance with the order requirements.
If you select
Deny
, the SmartResponse action does not run and its status in the Inspector panel changes to ""denied."" Administrators on the approval list may receive an email regarding the action (depending on whether their SIEM Person records include a valid email address).
If you select
Approve
and the SmartResponse action requires additional approvals, the Approved button dims to indicate that you have approved it. The number of additional approvals needed to run the action is displayed to the left of the button.
If no additional approvals are needed for a SmartResponse action, the Approved button is replaced with a message indicating whether the action succeeded or failed.
After all the actions have been either approved or denied, the SmartResponse action status on the alarm card updates to one of the following depending on their collective rates of success, failure, and/or denial:
Succeeded
Partial Failure
Failed
Partial Denied
Denied
Administrators on the approval list may also receive an email regarding the action results (depending on whether their SIEM Person records include a valid email address).
Succeeded
Partial Failure
Failed
Partial Denied
Denied
Administrators on the approval list may also receive an email regarding the action results (depending on whether their SIEM Person records include a valid email address).

"Currently, Cloud to Cloud log collection is available only for LogRhythm Cloud customers.
LogRhythm Cloud to Cloud (C2C) facilitates the creation, management, and collection of cloud log source information through a user interface in the Web Console. C2C credentials are used to safely and securely provision an appropriate collection method (either Open Collector with Beats or a System Monitor Agent).
In a future release, LogRhythm will host a System Monitor Agent in the cloud for collection of syslog from the Open Collector. This System Monitor Agent will also be able to collect cloud log sources that use the System Monitor Agent as their primary collection method. The Agent will have a maximum collection rate of 5000 MPS. Request for a System Monitor Agent is unnecessary.
As of LogRhythm 7.8.0, the
following beats are supported for C2C collection:
Azure Event Hub Beat
Carbon Black Cloud Beat
Cisco AMP Beat
Duo Authentication Security Beat
Gmail Message Tracking Beat
Okta Beat
PubSub Beat
Sophos Central Beat

API log sources:
Office365 Management activity
Office365 Message Tracking
AWS CloudTrail Events
AWS CloudWatch Events and Alarms
AWS Config Events
AWS Simple Storage Service (S3) Events
AWS S3 CloudTrail Events

For more details on configuring and initializing C2C collection using beats, see

Lists are an important part of the LogRhythm, Inc. software and are available in both the Client Console and the Web Console. Currently, the Web Console provides limited functionality for list management and use. Before using lists, it is important to understand list types, use contexts, multi-type lists, lists within lists, and permissions. For more background information about lists, see
Lists in the Client Console
.
The Web Console does not allow you to import lists, retire lists, or delete lists. All of these actions must be done in the Client Console.

Playbooks represent a way to store and manage standard procedures, including documentation of those procedures. Playbooks could be used for malware, phishing, or other processes such as unapproved software installations.
For many types of security incidents, there are standard and consistent steps that must be taken by security analysts. For example, if a user’s account is suspected to be compromised, a Suspected Account Compromise playbook may contain the following steps:
Locking down their account.
Contacting the suspicious user.
Contacting the suspicious user’s supervisor.
Investigating if that user name was associated with any suspicious activity.
An analyst would open a case, and import the Suspected Account Compromise playbook to auto-populate the above-described series of steps. The analyst could then optionally assign these to collaborators and track progress. This approach helps ensure that a consistent procedure is followed regardless of who is running the case.
You can download Playbooks
designed by the LogRhythm Threat Research Team
by going to the
LogRhythm Community
and clicking on the
Shareables
link on menu at the top of the page.
You can also manage playbooks through the REST API. For more information, go to https://<hostname>:8501/lr-case-api/docs#tag/playbooks.

The Reports page provides you with a customizable, widget-based web interface for direct access to your authorized report packages. Available report packages, including the individual reports inside them, are displayed in a grid format that can be filtered and sorted as needed. From the Reports grid you can also view additional package and report details, download reports in PDF format, and run new searches based on report criteria.
You cannot access your reports on the Web Console unless you have been assigned the permission to do so. Report permissions are managed by administrators through the Scheduled Report Job Wizard in the Client Console. For more information, see
Create Scheduled Reports
in the Client Console (Analyst Guide).
Note that if you change the Authorized User Profiles after a report has been run, users with newly granted access cannot see the report in the Web Console. You must run the report again for it to be visible to the new user profiles.
Reports grids are displayed through Completed Reports widgets. The default Reports page dashboard layout features one Completed Reports widget covering multiple dashboard rows and columns. The blue counters in the Name column indicate the number of individual reports contained in each report package. To view the individual reports in a package, click the
Plus
icon to left of the package name.

"LogRhythm Web Console Single Sign-On (SSO) uses industry-standard Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) and supported third-party Identity Providers (IdP) to authenticate and authorize Web Console users. With SSO, customers can manage their users' logons via supported Identity Providers, including Okta, PingOne, and Azure AD.
SAML 2.0 is an XML-based protocol that uses security tokens containing assertions to pass information about a security principal (usually an end user) between a SAML authority, named an Identity Provider (IdP), and a SAML consumer, named a Service Provider (SP).
Existing Web Console users can implement SSO with their previously-created credentials. New Web Console users can be auto-provisioned, resulting in new Person records (with an associated Login record and User Profile) in the Client Console.
For an SSO user to successfully log in to the Web Console, the Login field from their Person record in the Client Console must match the nameID field from the IdP SAML assertion. For more information, see
SSO User Auto-Provisioning
and
SSO Known Issues and Recommendations
.


You must access the Web Console via a browser within a corporate network or with a correctly-configured VPN if your browser is outside the primary corporate network. This is important because you must be able to resolve and establish a connection to the internal FQDN, hostname, or IP address of the Web Console Server. Publicly-accessible configurations are possible but require additional setup of firewalls, routers, and publicly-trusted certificates.
If you want multiple Web Consoles to support SSO, they must be in a load-balanced configuration. This is required because the configuration is part of the Authentication Service that is common to all Web Consoles. If you have multiple Web Consoles in a non-load-balanced configuration, you must choose one to use with SSO. You must specify which Web Console to use in the SSO configuration parameter Web Console Callback URL.
In the LogRhythm Configuration Manager, ensure the following values are selected:
Open the LogRhythm Configuration Manager.
In the bottom-left next to Advanced View, click
Show
.
Scroll down to the Authentication API section.
Ensure the parameters are set as follows:
Parameter
Setting
Web Console Multi-factor Authentication Type
Off: If you are not currently using Web Console MFA.
On: If you have local logins and/or AD logins that do not use SSO.
This setting applies only to local (SQL) or Active Directory logins. Web Console MFA will not be used for SSO logins.
Web Console SQL Authentication
Enabled
Web Console Active Directory Authentication
Enabled
This setting may be turned off later to allow only SQL and SSO logins.
Web Console Multi-factor Authentication Type
If you want to use multi-factor authentication in conjunction with Web Console SSO, you must enable it in the same Identity Provider that you use for Web Console SSO so that all of your SSO authentication functions are housed in your preferred IdP.
Ensure the parameters are set as follows:
Off: If you are not currently using Web Console MFA.
On: If you have local logins and/or AD logins that do not use SSO.
This setting applies only to local (SQL) or Active Directory logins. Web Console MFA will not be used for SSO logins.
Enabled
This setting may be turned off later to allow only SQL and SSO logins.
Web Console Multi-factor Authentication Type
If you want to use multi-factor authentication in conjunction with Web Console SSO, you must enable it in the same Identity Provider that you use for Web Console SSO so that all of your SSO authentication functions are housed in your preferred IdP.

"SIEM management and auditing functions require every Web Console user to be associated with a Person record and Login field in the Client Console.
During a Single Sign-On (SSO) login, the SIEM identifies user associations by comparing the following fields:

If the SIEM cannot identify a Person record with a Login field that matches the nameID field from the Identity Provider (IdP), the SIEM creates a new Person record and associated User Login record with the following values:
Auto-provisioning will fail if the Name field in an existing Person record contains the same unique combination of first name and last name provided in the IdP. In this case, a SIEM administrator must modify the existing Person record by updating the Name field with a different combination of first name and last name. For subsequent SSO logins, this user will be associated with the auto-provisioned user.


SSO auto-provisioned users who did not previously exist in the Client Console may initially only log in to the Web Console via SSO because the SSO auto-provisioned user is assigned a random, complex, and unknowable password on first login. If these users want to use their SSO auto-provisioned account to log in without SSO, either to the Client Console or the Web Console, a SIEM administrator can execute the following procedure:
Before executing this procedure:
If you want the SSO auto-provisioned user's new password to be synched with Active Directory, you must first create this user login using either Active Directory Group-Based Authorization or manually creating a Person record tied to a Windows/AD account.

Log in to the Client Console as a SIEM administrator.
On the main toolbar, click
Deployment Manager
.
Click the
People
tab.
Right-click on the user's Person Record, and then click
User Account Properties
.
Before proceeding, make sure you understand the Enforce Password Policy setting and the implications of changing it.
Enforce Password Policy
The Enforce Password Policy settings are retrieved from Windows Local Security Policy. (You can view this policy with the Windows MMC Local Security Policy (secpol.msc) in the Password Policy folder.) The default setting for Minimum Password Age is 1 day. If the SIEM administrator resets a user password with this default setting, the user cannot change their own password for 1 day unless the SIEM administrator disables the Enforce Password Policy. When the SIEM administrator changes the Enforce Password Policy setting, the following warning message is triggered:
You have chosen to change password policy enforcement. This will require you to reset the user password. If you wish to continue with this operation, click OK. Otherwise click Cancel.
The SIEM administrator can disable the Enforce Password Policy setting and immediately change the user's password. However, if the SIEM administrator later re-enables this setting, the warning message is triggered again and the password must be reset again.
If the SIEM administrator does not want to disable the Enforce Password Policy setting, there are two options:
1. After resetting the user's password, the user must wait 1 day to change it.
2. The SIEM administrator can set the Minimum Password Age to 0 days, and the user can change their password immediately. This option is not available to LR Cloud customers.

2. The SIEM administrator can set the Minimum Password Age to 0 days, and the user can change their password immediately. This option is not available to LR Cloud customers.
In Account Options, set Enforce Password Policy based on your preferred option as outlined in the above note.
After changing the user's password, give them their temporary password.
The user must login to the Web Console via SSO using their normal SSO credentials.
Upon successful login with SSO credentials, the user must then change their password to the temporary password provided by the SIEM administrator.
In the User Options menu, click
Settings
, then click
Change Password
.
Enter the temporary password in the Old Password field.
Enter the desired new password in the New Password field.
This new password will be used to log in to the Client Console.
Click
Save
.

The new password will not be synchronized with Active Directory and must be manually updated. If the user wants their password synchronized with Active Directory,
you must first create this user login using either Active Directory Group-Based Authorization or manually creating a Person record tied to a Windows/AD account.

We recommend you disable AD authentication in Configuration Manager to force SSO use and encourage pre-existing AD authentication users to start using SSO authentication.
AD Authentication can be re-enabled for troubleshooting
and can coexist with SSO if AD authentication is also required.
We recommend you disable AD authentication in Configuration Manager to force SSO use and encourage pre-existing AD authentication users to start using SSO authentication.
AD Authentication can be re-enabled for troubleshooting
and can coexist with SSO if AD authentication is also required.

For a consistent and reliable SSO experience, we recommend using the Identity Provider (IdP) in conjunction with Active Directory to Identity Provider (AD-to-IdP) synchronization.


SSO with MFA is only possible using IdP multi-factor authentication. The MFA setting in Configuration Manager applies only to SQL and Active Directory logins.


SSO currently supports multiple web consoles in a load-balanced configuration. This configuration is not part of the LogRhythm SIEM and would require a third-party hardware or software solution. The SSO configuration is part of the Authentication Service that is common to all Web Consoles. If you have multiple Web Consoles in a non-load-balanced configuration, you must choose one to use with SSO. You must specify which Web Console to use in the SSO configuration parameter Web Console Callback URL.


When the Web Console saves the SSO configuration, users may see the following sequence of statuses in the upper-right corner:
Yellow Disconnecting status.
Red Disconnected status.
Notification message: You have lost the live data connection. Please check your internet connection and refresh your browser.
Refresh your browser to reconnect the Web Console.


SQL Authentication must be enabled in Configuration Manager for SSO to work. SSO will fail if SQL Authentication is disabled.


When a user is auto-provisioned via SSO, the Description field in their Client Console Person record is populated with ""Auto Provisioning <firstName> <lastName>"".
The uniqueness determinant for user matching with LogRhythm SSO is the combination of first name and last name in the Name field of the Client Console Person record. SSO auto-provisioning fails when a second user happens to have the same unique combination of first name and last name that matches an existing Person record. Using first name and last name as the uniqueness determinant can cause issues when the same person has two or more logins (for example, Chris User the analyst, and Chris User the administrator of the SOC), or when two people have the same first name and last name.
SSO user auto-provisioning for the second user fails because the first name and last name match an existing Name field in the Client Console Person record.
It does not matter if the Login field is different (for example, Chris.User@company.com and Chris-Admin.User@company.com).
The middle name is not used to determine uniqueness.
SSO user auto-provisioning for the second user fails because the first name and last name match an existing Name field in the Client Console Person record.
It does not matter if the Login field is different (for example, Chris.User@company.com and Chris-Admin.User@company.com).
The middle name is not used to determine uniqueness.
Workaround:
Manually edit the user's Name field in the Person record (for example, change the first name to Joe-Admin so the resulting first name and last name combination is Joe-Admin User).
Additional Issues:
This change may not be acceptable to a company's HR department.
If the user is part of AD Group-Based Synchronization, the AD admin must perform the manual edit because AD is the source authority for AD-synchronized users.

Object is the specific driver component that failed to load (\driver\usbuhci). ObjectName is the DriverName. Both are correct as the referenced object is the driver component, and ObjectName expands on this with the full driver name.

SDF_COMBO_ALERT
[**] [Classification: Sensitive Data was Transmitted Across the Network] [Priority: 2] {PROTO:254} 1.1.1.1 -> 1.1.1.1
SDF_COMBO_ALERT parses into Object. This is incorrect because SDF_COMBO_ALERT indicates the type of log message, rather than what object is impacted or referenced in the log. In this example, the Object field should not be used.

; }
The Success value is parsed incorrectly from the key status into Object. It should parse into Status instead. In this example, the Object field should not be used.

The
Location value should not parse into Object, as this can be inferred, and entities can be used to gather this type of data. Location should be tied to the entity structure. In this case, the Object field should not be used. Application in a log could be Process or Object, depending on the analysis of additional samples.

The log notice may be a hostname or a device name (such as an AP). It is ambiguous whether this strictly meets the definition of object impacted, object referenced, or something else. In this case, the field could be a device, serial number, or other identifier. Object is not incorrect, but this log source should be researched further.

Product could parse into Process instead of Object. Object is not incorrect, but may be confusing. In this case, the product does not define a runnable process on the system, so Object is a better choice than Process.

Banned_src and banned_rule parse into Object and Object Name, respectively. These are ambiguous because the source and rule are related to one another, but source refers to a denial of service attack, which is more of an action than a resource.
In this case, banned_rule could be parsed into Policy and banned_src could parse into Object (because the rule acted on the ""dos"" src).

Database and Log parse into Object Name and Object, respectively. A database meets the criteria of a resource referenced or impacted in this log. However, the log seems closer to a command, action, or result (log parses into Command).
The database value should parse into Object, and the log should parse into Command. Object Name should not be used.

The domain of the URL parses into Object Name in the referrer field in both logs. Strictly speaking, this is a referenced object, but Object is not used in the first log, so there is no relation. In the second log, Subtype parses into Object and the domain of the URL parses into Object Name. There is no relation between these fields in the second instance, as subtype describes the event rather than a resource.
In these logs, the ref field defines an outside URL to additional information. It is not the object of the log or the name of the object. The ref field should parse into the Vendor Information field. There is no need to have an Object or Object Name for this log source.

06 07 2013 09:29:36 1.1.1.1 <LOC3:WARN> ECD[12901]: b7fd WARN ECD: (31516556428) Warning of credential expiry.  Details [[friendlyName=
Onboard SSL credential
for
www.recordflow.
biz][days since expiry:161]]
Friendly name parses into Object Name and the subsequent hostname parses into Object. Object should parse into impacted host (dname) in this log. Object Name is strictly correct with the usage of object for the hostname, but would probably be better for Object after that is changed to dname.
If onboard SSL Credential parses into Object, then Object Name is empty. Also, the rule name and common event probably captures it already ""credential expiry."" Look at other samples to see if there are other types of credential besides the one shown here.

"The resource type (file type) referenced or impacted by activity reported in the log, specifically related to what is parsed into Object. Object Type is a categorization field in comparison to Object Name, which is a specific description of the value in Object.
This field is not available in LogRhythm versions earlier than 7.2.1.

Object Type is a categorization of the resource described in Object.
Object Type is a broader classification whereas Object Name is a specific name or description.

AV software
HTTP access logs

Sub-classification when the event type is not enough.

Not applicable.

Object Type does not require an Object. For example, a file scanner might create a log looking for .gif and not find any. The Object Type would be GIF, but there is no Object because no files were found.
Do not use Object Type with any other specialty field, such as Hash, Process, Subject, and so on. Object Type only applies to Object.

HTTP access log. Object Type could contain the MIME type of file(s)

In this case, Object is authchk.exe. Object Name is blank even though the source log explicitly calls it out. If the log had a field that called Auto check process or some other expanded description or friendly name of the object, then that value would parse into Object Name. Object Type would parse into File.

Response Code should be industry standard. If it is a vendor standard, use VMID.
If the value is unstructured text, use Result instead.
This supplants VMID completely for parsing HTTP and SMTP response codes. In other words, VMID should be tied to a vendor while HTTP codes are an independent standard.
This field can be extended to non-IT industry response codes. For example, credit card response codes if ATM or POS logs are parsed, and ICS/SCADA-specific protocols.

Not applicable.

Result is the outcome of an occurence and should be tied to a command, action, or policy.
Result should not contain industry standard response codes such as HTTP response codes.
If given a choice, use VMID/Vendor Info if the log is just a message and not tied to an action/command. Use Result if the log contains a clear action/command. For example, VMID/Vendor Info might be tied to ""Attempted quarantine"" and the result might be ""success.”
Do not take result in the log literally. It could be a result, a VMID, or a status.

Categorizing data within the log, not the actual log message (use VMID, Vendor Info instead).
UEBA—sub category of anomaly type.

Not applicable.

Use Subject as a category field only if another field is not more directly named (for example, Vendor Info).

A usable server cannot be found on which to launch the application.

Based on the current standard this is incorrect; the above parses a description of the event into Subject. The Vendor Info tag can supplant this usage. This needs to parse into Vendor Info.

Subject is parsing the entire event data. This is too broad and makes any kind of normalization impossible. This should be parsed into multiple fields including Object, Action, and Vendor Info.

Syslog reports severity in the format <loc0:info>, with info being the severity level.
Windows Event Log severity

Anything that generates alarms or analyzes risk.
Almost every log format has a severity.

Multilingual logs might have severity in native language. Use masking to convert to standard English. (See Windows logs, for example.)

Represent the severity the way the vendor/log source does in the clearest text way. Do not attempt to convert 0-5 to low/medium/high or red/yellow/green unless the vendor defines 0 = low.
Do not misuse for level of confidence (for example, from an AV log).

Polyfield – Impacted Host

Do not override/overload, use <dip> not (?<dip>.*?).
Impacted is server (In Client-Server Model).
Impacted is Target (In Attacker-Target Model).
Use when you see an Impacted IP address IPv4 or IPv6, unless it is an IPv4 address mapped to IPv6, in which case use <dipv6e>.

Any field you do not use to create subrules—for example, command.

Not applicable.

Creating subrules not based on VMID, ThreatID, or Severity.

They are invisible outside of MPE Rule Builder.

If you want to create a subrule of a value not captured into VMID, ThreatID, or Severity, a tag must be nested within the existing metatag.

These tags can be used in a wide variety of situations. Because these fields do not appear as parsed fields outside of the rule builder, refer to the usage standards to determine when to use these fields.

"LogRhythm licensing has been designed to allow licenses to be assigned and transferred between components centrally. There is no need to type license keys directly into each LogRhythm component, making deployment much simpler. Instead, you import your license file into the LogRhythm License Manager and assign available licenses to the deployed components.

The LogRhythm Solution requires a LogRhythm license file which contains a LogRhythm Master License and Component Licenses. The Master License is tied to an individual customer for a single deployment of LogRhythm (1 Platform Manager and 1 or more Data Processors). Component Licenses fall within the Master License and are used to license specific LogRhythm components within the same LogRhythm deployment.
A LogRhythm license file can contain the following component and subscription licenses:
Platform Manager License (always included)

Advanced Intelligence Engine License (separate volume license)
GeoIP Resolution Subscription License

The License for Platform Manager is automatically assigned. Licenses for all other components are assigned when the component is created or assigned via the LogRhythm Deployment Manager.
The Deployment Manager attempts to license all newly created components. If a license is unavailable, you are notified. A license can later be assigned via the Deployment Manager.
The Deployment Manager first tries to assign a System Monitor Pro license to an agent, if one is available; otherwise, it assigns a System Monitor Lite license.
When a Data Processor starts, it validates its license. If a license is not assigned, has expired, or has been tampered with, the Data Processor Mediator Server process terminates.
When the Data Processor Mediator Server process authenticates System Monitor Agents, it validates the license of the Agent and all reporting Log Message Sources.
If the Agent is not assigned a license, has expired, or been tampered with, the Agent is not allowed to connect to the Data Processor.
If a Data Processor has exceeded the assigned number of Message (Log) Source licenses (in limited licensing mode), additional log sources are not able to send log messages to the Data Processor.

A LogRhythm Data Processor is licensed in one of two modes:
Software Mode
. Used if you purchased the LogRhythm licenses as a software package.
Appliance Mode
. Used if you purchased the LogRhythm licenses as part of a LogRhythm appliance.
Each Data Processor also has a Log Source licensing mode that determines the number of log sources the Data Processor is licensed to handle:
Limited Mode
. Data Processor is licensed to handle a fixed number of log sources.
Unlimited Mode
. Data Processor is licensed to handle an unlimited number of log sources.

Each Log Message Source from which an Agent collects logs must have a corresponding license, except for the following log sources (which are considered part of the Agent): Data Loss Defender (DLD), User Activity Monitor (UAM), Process Monitor (PM), Network Connection Monitor (NCM), File Integrity Monitor (FIM), Syslog Server, and IPFIX/NetFlow/J-Flow Server. However, virtualized Log Message Sources collected by the Syslog or NetFlow/J-Flow Servers do need Log Message Source licenses.
Log Message Source licenses are available in packs of varying size. Data Processors use license packs as a whole, as assigned in the Data Processor Licensing Wizard. As Agents connect, they authenticate Log Message Sources, which consume licenses on a first come, first served basis. As Agent connections to the Data Processor close, the Log Message Source licenses are returned to an unclaimed state, and can be consumed by the next connecting Agent.

You must license each LogRhythm System Monitor to connect to a Data Processor and forward data. LogRhythm provides three types of System Monitor licenses:
System Monitor Lite
System Monitor Pro
System Monitor Collector
When a System Monitor is registered in the Deployment Manager, it is automatically assigned a System Monitor Pro license, if one is available; otherwise it assigns a System Monitor Lite license. To view the features associated with System Monitor Lite and Pro licenses, see the
System Monitor Functionality by License: Lite, Pro, and Collector
table in LogRhythm Compatibility and System Monitor Functionality Guide.

LogRhythm includes SQL Server enterprise Runtime as part of the LogRhythm Solution (Appliance or Software). LogRhythm also provides an initial number of User Client Access Licenses (CALs) for SQL Server Licensing. The initial CALs are included in the purchase of the LogRhythm Solution; however, if you require additional CALs above the initial set included, they must be purchased from LogRhythm.
CALs apply to a single deployment for LogRhythm (1 Platform Manager and 1 or more Data Processors). Because CALs apply to a LogRhythm deployment, they are only provided with EM or XM Appliances and EM or XM Software Sales.
Either 3 or 5 user CALs are included with a LogRhythm purchase depending on the software and/or appliance purchased. Client Access Licenses (CALs) provide one device CAL for the appliance services and allow up to four simultaneous LogRhythm Client Console connections. Deployments that require more than four must purchase additional CALs to ensure license compliance. If you require additional SQL Server CALs, contact your Customer Relationship Manager (CRM).
The LogRhythm Solution will come with a SQL Server End User License Agreement (EULA) for the specific appliance purchased. View your license to determine the number of CALs you have purchased.
Every user who has a login for LogRhythm requires one user CAL. Please note the following:
1 CAL is automatically used by the LogRhythm Administrator default account
1 CAL is automatically used by the LogRhythm Analyst default account
To determine the number of CALs a LogRhythm deployment requires, refer to the
Person tab
in Deployment Manager. Count every Person record where Has Login is selected. This is the number of CALs required.

"LogRhythm processes your organization's raw log data and presents it in a way that makes it easier to analyze and protect your network operations. For a complete list of metadata fields that LogRhythm parses, calculates, and derives from raw log data, see the
LogRhythm Schema Dictionary and Guide
. Note that while all metadata fields are available in the Web Console, not all are available in the Client Console.
LogRhythm components collect and process log messages as follows:
LogRhythm
Agents
monitor devices in the network (servers, routers, etc.), where they collect raw log data and forward it to a Data Processor. Agents can be installed on both Windows and UNIX platforms.
The
Data Processor
is the central processing engine for log messages. Its integrated Mediator Server contains the Message Processing Engine (MPE), which is responsible for the following:
Assigning a Log Source based on where the log originated. For example, a Log could be from a Windows server, a UNIX host, a networking device, or an application.
Identifying a Log Type (Common Event), which amounts to a short, plain-language description of the log.
Assigning a Log Classification that includes one of three major classifications (Operations, Audit, or Security) and a specific sub-classification.
Identifying Events, which are important logs that may be of interest or concern (typically less than 5% of your total log activity).
Parsing and deriving metadata from the raw logs, and when applicable, adding contextual information such as the known application or geographic location.

The Data Processor forwards logs categorized as MPE events to the
Platform Manager
. If the Advanced Intelligence Engine (AI Engine) is integrated into the LogRhythm SIEM deployment, the Data Processor can also send copies of log messages to the AI Engine.

Platform Manager
. If the Advanced Intelligence Engine (AI Engine) is integrated into the LogRhythm SIEM deployment, the Data Processor can also send copies of log messages to the AI Engine.
The
AI Engine
(if integrated) evaluates logs using a pattern matching and behavioral rule set that can correlate and detect complex issues such as sophisticated intrusions, insider threats, operational issues, and compliance issues. If a log triggers one of the AIE rules, the AI Engine generates a new AIE event for the Platform Manager Database.

If a log triggers one of the AIE rules, the AI Engine generates a new AIE event for the Platform Manager Database.
The
Platform Manager
receives event data from the Data Processors and the AI Engine. It includes an Alarming and Response Manager (ARM), which evaluates the events against rules for alarms and initiates the appropriate response. The Platform Manager also serves as the central point of access for LogRhythm SIEM. It houses the databases for events, alerts, and metadata, and includes all the configuration information.

LogRhythm Message Processing Engine (MPE) rules are designed with the intent of parsing log messages at the Information (syslog severity) level and above. By their very nature,
Debug
and
Verbose
log messages contain low-level information that would not normally appear (using default logging configurations) within typical operational, audit, or security log messages. Given this, the lack of parsing/normalization of log messages at the
Debug
(or
Verbose
) logging levels is intentional and for several reasons, some of which are conceptual and others more mechanical.
Most devices will generate an order of magnitude greater log volume when set to the
Verbose
or
Debug
logging levels. The result of this is system impacting on multiple fronts with the most critical being processing via the MPE and indexing via the Data Indexer (DX). Specifically, while
Verbose
and
Debug
logs will inevitably hit Catch All rules, they will not only cause an immense MPE slow down, but also many stalled/disabled rules, spooling, and overall poor performance as they attempt to process through every rule in the policy. In addition to this, indexing will be impacted, whereas the logs cause a backup of spooled reliable persist files, resulting in poor DX performance.
Again, while
Debug
and
Verbose
logging may be beneficial in development and system troubleshooting scenarios, heavy volume log sources and/or enabling such logs for longer periods of time could potentially result in a drastic impact on overall system performance, so normalization of these log messages does not occur as part of the LogRhythm MPE feature.

The devices in your network are generating thousands of raw logs at every moment. These logs are generated in a wide variety of formats, and they represent varying degrees of importance in maintaining and protecting your network. LogRhythm processes raw log data to make information available to you in a meaningful and uniform context.
Understanding how LogRhythm processes the raw log data helps you configure your LogRhythm deployment to get the fullest benefit and most useful output. LogRhythm log processing includes:
Initial Processing
Assign a Log Source
Identify a Common Event
Assign a Classification
Identify Events

In the following examples, we will use this raw log:
08 13 2009 15:21:19 1.1.2.1 <LOC4:ERRR> Aug 13 2009 15:21:19 GSC-Internet-FW: %ASA-3-106014:
Deny inbound icmp src INSIDE:4.2.1.3 dst INSIDE:4.1.1.1 (type 0, code 0)
After the example log is reviewed, examples are provided for other common types of logs.


Log Sources are unique log originators on a specific Host. A Host can have more than one Log Source. For example, a typical Windows Server Host would include System Event Logs, Application Event Logs, and Security Event Logs.
LogRhythm identifies the Log Source to:
Determine where the log originated.
Assign the Log Source to the correct set of base rules called a Message Processing Engine (MPE) policy.
Process the log against the assigned MPE policy. Processing against an MPE policy instead of the complete set of rules is a tremendous gain in efficiency. The information in the example log allows LogRhythm to identify it as a Cisco ASA Log Source. Now LogRhythm can process the log against a specific rule base.

Processing the log against the appropriate rule base identifies the Common Event—a short, plain-language description of the log.

Based on the Common Event, LogRhythm can assign a classification which includes one of three
major
classifications–Operations, Audit, or Security–and a more specific
sub-classification
. Here are some examples:
Audit: Authentication Failure
Operations: Network Deny
Security: Suspicious
Results for initial processing of our example log:
Log Source = Cisco ASA
Matched Rule = PIX-106014: Denied Packet
Common Event = Denied Packet
Classification = Operations: Network Deny

LogRhythm recognizes that some logs are more important to your organization's operation, security, and compliance than others. In the identification process, more important logs are designated as Events–generally this will be around 10% of your total log activity.

LogRhythm parses, calculates, and derives metadata from logs. The metadata fields go into a database to help speed performance when you use LogRhythm search tools such as Investigator, Personal Dashboard, and Reporting. Logs identified as Events and the associated metadata are also sent to LogMart unless specifically configured not to do so.
For a complete list of metadata fields, see the
LogRhythm Schema Dictionary and Guide
. Note that while all metadata fields are available in the Web Console, not all are available in the Client Console.
LogRhythm derived metadata fields store network and host information pulled from the log message.
Where space is restricted such as column headings, reports, and grids, i and o are used as abbreviations for Impacted and Origin. For example, Impacted Zone and Origin Zone may appear as iZone and oZone. Other metadata fields also use abbreviations or short names, in report column headings when space is restricted.
After additional processing, the following information is available for our example log:

When a product release version reaches End of Support Life, it will no longer be supported by LogRhythm’s technical support services.
This document also
explains the differences between major and minor patches, which will help you in identifying the version you are running.

Like all software, it is important to keep up to date with versions. With each version release, there are often security updates, patches, defects resolved and, of course, new features. In order for our Support and Engineering teams to engage and assist, the deployment needs to be on a supported version of the product.

Please visit our website and fill in the
license request form
. You will need it before you upgrade. Our Fulfillment team will generate and send it to you by email.

Customers with a current support contract are able to download upgrades from our
Documents and Downloads
section on the Community site. You can either upgrade yourself using the guides or engage our Professional Services team to perform the upgrade. More on this follows.

You have a couple of options for upgrading your deployment:
You can follow the lengthy upgrade documentation on our Community site to perform the upgrade yourself. Please pay particular attention to the upgrade paths. If you run into any challenges when upgrading, please log a support case though the Support Portal. Our global support team will be happy to help you.
Our Professional Services team can perform the upgrade for you as a billable service.
If you don't already have an open project with Professional Services, please contact your Customer Success Manager or your account representative to scope and purchase this service.
If you have an open project, please work with your assigned Project Manager to determine if this upgrade can be worked into your existing scope and schedule. If you don't know your Project Manager, please use one of the following aliases.

Following is a visual of the SIEM table. To determine the versions you need to upgrade to get to the latest SIEM version, find the version of LogRhythm SIEM you are running and follow the arrows.


For NetMon, we have a table that details the paths.
To find the version of the SIEM you are running, use the previous SIEM table.
To find your NetMon version, use the following NetMon table.
To find the version you need to go to next, browse the Upgrade Path column in the NetMon table.
For older versions, you may need to perform a hop2 upgrade to a version before being able to proceed to the next/latest version.
To find the version you need to go to next, browse the Upgrade Path column in the NetMon table.
For older versions, you may need to perform a hop2 upgrade to a version before being able to proceed to the next/latest version.
NetMon Version
Upgrade Path
Description
Versions earlier than 2.6.1
Not supported
An upgrade path for versions earlier than 2.6.1 is not recommended. To upgrade, perform a new installation with version 4.0.3.
Versions 2.6.1 to 2.8.1
Upgrade to 2.8.2
A CentOS dependency requires you to upgrade to 2.8.2 before continuing the upgrade process.
Versions 2.8.2 to 3.2.1
Upgrade to 3.2.2
A CentOS 7.2 upgrade requires you to upgrade to 3.2.2 before continuing the upgrade process.
Version 3.2.2
Upgrade to 3.2.3
A user interface change requires to upgrade to 3.2.3 before continuing the upgrade process.
Version 3.2.3
Upgrade to 3.6.1
In previous versions of NetMon, upgrading to the newest version could reset your custom engine configuration settings to the NetMon defaults. Starting in NetMon 3.6.1 and in all future releases, upgrades will not change your custom settings back to the default values
NetMon 3.6.2 was a critical security update, and all users running older versions of NetMon should upgrade to 3.6.2 or later as soon as possible.
Versions 3.6.1 to 3.9.3
Upgrade to 4.0.1
If upgrading from a pre-3.9.1 release, a new security certificate is included with the install. In this case, the upgrade page does not automatically refresh after the system reboots. The upgrade usually takes about 15 minutes, after which you must manually refresh your browser and log in to NetMon again,
The upgrade to NetMon 4.0.1 is a best-effort migration of existing Elasticsearch 1.7 data into Elasticsearch 7.2.
Re-indexing Elasticsearch 1.7 data to Elasticsearch 7.2 takes significant time up to several hours per 10 GB of metadata, depending on the size of the indices.
Versions 4.0.1 to 4.0.4
Upgrade to 4.0.5
If you are upgrading from NetMon 3.6.1 - 3.9.3 and performed the intermediate upgrade step to NetMon 4.0.1, you must wait until the 4.0.1 nm-reindexer process finishes before upgrading to 4.0.5. The 4.0.1 nm-reindexer process migrates the previous Elasticsearch 1.7 indices to the Elasticsearch 7.2 index format.

The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.

COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (""Commercial Contributor"") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (""Indemnified Contributor"") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively ""Losses"") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.

While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (""Commercial Contributor"") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (""Indemnified Contributor"") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively ""Losses"") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.

The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991
Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
Preamble
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.
Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.
Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The ""Program"", below, refers to any such program or work, and a ""work based on the Program"" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term ""modification"".) Each licensee is addressed as ""you"".
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program. You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.
3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.
6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice. This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.
8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and ""any later version"", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
NO WARRANTY
11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the ""copyright"" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>
This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.
You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type 'show c' for details.
The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called something other than 'show w' and 'show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a ""copyright disclaimer"" for the program, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program 'Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public License instead of this License.
""CLASSPATH"" EXCEPTION TO THE GPL
Certain source files distributed by Oracle America and/or its affiliates are subject to the following clarification and special exception to the GPL, but only where Oracle has expressly included in the particular source file's header the words ""Oracle designates this particular file as subject to the ""Classpath"" exception as provided by Oracle in the LICENSE file that accompanied this code.""
Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making a combined work based on this library. Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.
As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that module. An independent module is a module which is not derived from or based on this library. If you modify this library, you may extend this exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to do so. If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement from your version.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT LICENSING
Certain files distributed by Oracle America, Inc. and/or its affiliates are subject to the following clarification and special exception to the GPLv2, based on the GNU Project exception for its Classpath libraries, known as the GNU Classpath Exception.
Note that Oracle includes multiple, independent programs in this software package. Some of those programs are provided under licenses deemed incompatible with the GPLv2 by the Free Software Foundation and others. For example, the package includes programs licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 and may include FreeType. Such programs are licensed to you under their original licenses.
Oracle facilitates your further distribution of this package by adding the Classpath Exception to the necessary parts of its GPLv2 code, which permits you to use that code in combination with other independent modules not licensed under the GPLv2. However, note that this would not permit you to commingle code under an incompatible license with Oracle's GPLv2 licensed code by, for example, cutting and pasting such code into a file also containing Oracle's GPLv2 licensed code and then distributing the result.
Additionally, if you were to remove the Classpath Exception from any of the files to which it applies and distribute the result, you would likely be required to license some or all of the other code in that distribution under the GPLv2 as well, and since the GPLv2 is incompatible with the license terms of some items included in the distribution by Oracle, removing the Classpath Exception could therefore effectively compromise your ability to further distribute the package.
Failing to distribute notices associated with some files may also create unexpected legal consequences.
Proceed with caution and we recommend that you obtain the advice of a lawyer skilled in open source matters before removing the Classpath Exception or making modifications to this package which may subsequently be redistributed and/or involve the use of third party software.

ØMQ Free Software Licenses
The ØMQ library is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (see below). All add-ons and examples are published under the GNU General Public License.
You get the full source code of ØMQ. You can examine the code, modify it, and share your modified code under the terms of the LGPL.
Static linking exception. The copyright holders give you permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that module. An independent module is a module which is not derived from or based on this library. If you modify this library, you must extend this exception to your version of the library.
ØMQ for Commercial Applications
ØMQ is safe for use in close-source applications. The LGPL share-alike terms do not apply to applications built on top of ØMQ.
You do not need a commercial license. The LGPL applies to ØMQ's own source code, not your applications. Many commercial applications use ØMQ.
GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
0. Additional Definitions.
As used herein, “this License” refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the “GNU GPL” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
“The Library” refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.
An “Application” is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.
A “Combined Work” is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the “Linked Version”.
The “Minimal Corresponding Source” for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.
The “Corresponding Application Code” for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.
Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.
Conveying Modified Versions.
If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:
under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.
Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:
Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.
Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.
Combined Works.
You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:
Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.
Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.
For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
Do one of the following:
0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.
1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.
Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)
Combined Libraries.
You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:
Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.
Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.

You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.
3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s).
3.4. Notices
You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
3.5. Application of Additional Terms
You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership with others.
The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
DEFINITIONS
""Font Software"" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may include source files, build scripts and documentation.
""Reserved Font Name"" refers to any names specified as such after the copyright statement(s).
""Original Version"" refers to the collection of Font Software components as distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).
""Modified Version"" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting, or substituting — in part or in whole — any of the components of the Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a new environment.
""Author"" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.
PERMISSION & CONDITIONS
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify, redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font Software, subject to the following conditions:
Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components, in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.
Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled, redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.
No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as presented to the users.
The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written permission.
The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole, must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply to any document created using the Font Software.
TERMINATION
This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are not met.
DISCLAIMER
THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED ""AS IS"", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF COPYRIGHT, PATENT, TRADEMARK, OR OTHER RIGHT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY,
